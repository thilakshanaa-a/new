**Requirements**: You need to have completed [all four lessons of this unit](README.md)


## Objectives & Outlines

By the end of this exercise, you should be able to:

## Brief

Modify the script `code/toneanalyzer.py` provided in this repository to integrate the following changes:

- It should display each emotional tone with its corresponding `score` on a separate line using the format `Label, score`.
- You can display these lines in any given order.
