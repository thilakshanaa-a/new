## Check your work ðŸ’ª

To verify that your instance has been created, go to the [Service Dashboard](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/dashboard/services) page of the Bluemix console. You should see now a list of the existing instances.

If your landing page looks like this instead:

it means you haven't any created instance (try to scroll down to see if the list).
