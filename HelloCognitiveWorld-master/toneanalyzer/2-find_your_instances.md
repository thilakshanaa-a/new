## \#1 Find and open an existing service instance

2. If you have some existing instances, it should provide a list of those:

  If instead your landing page looks like this instead:

  ![IBM Bluemix Console](img/ibm_dashboard_services.png)

  it means you haven't any created instance (try to scroll down to see if the list).

  You should then report to the lesson on [creating instances of services](1-create_instance.md)
