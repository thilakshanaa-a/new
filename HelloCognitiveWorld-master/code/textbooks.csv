1,0070428077,"I read this book about 7 years ago while in the PhD program at Stanford University. I consider this book not only the best Machine Learning book, but one of the best books in all of Computer Science. It covers every branch of ML I know of and it covers it really well. I found Mitchell's chapter on Neural Networks more insightful than an entire book on NN's that I read. I also found his chapter on Reinforcement Learning more useful and better explained than an entire book on Reinforcement Learning that I also read. The other chapters cover other ML topics at the same level of quality and rigor.The author did an amazing job in covering the breadth and depth of ML in less than 500 pages. I hope he will write a new edition to cover the advances that happened in the last decade.",Machine Learning,50.27
2,0070428077,"If you are interested in the topic of machine learning, this is the start book for you. It is quite informative and covers the actual methods of learning and the concepts involved. It is not the most readable but the author does a good job livening it up. For that matter, I do not know how to convey the topic in a readable fashion so compared against other similar books, the presentation is outstanding. For those in the field, this is a must.",Machine Learning,50.27
3,0070428077,"This book serves as an excellent introduction to machine learning.  The material covers a broad range of important machine learning concepts and algorithms.  The text is well-written and well-organized, and I use it frequently as a reference.  In addition to describing the basic theory and mechanics of the algorithms, the book helps develop an intuitive feel for the algorithms and provides examples of how they have been used.That said, the coverage of the theory behind the algorithms is fairly superficial.  Additionally, having been written in 1997, many recent algorithms such as SVMs and methods such as Adaboost are not covered.  For those reasons, this book cannot serve as a stand-alone text book for a course.",Machine Learning,50.27
4,0070428077,"Intelligent machines can be characterized, at least qualitatively, by the degree to which they require interaction with another intelligent machine in order to learn or engage in problem solving, the degree to which they can construct theories explaining data in a given domain, the degree to which they can think in more than one domain, the degree of curiosity that they possess, and the degree to which they take on these tasks by themselves and not under the instigation of an external entity. There are many (non-human) machines today that have some of these characteristics, thanks in part to the research contained in this book, among many others.The book is a collection of work in artificial intelligence that was undertaken almost 25 years ago, but some of it is still relevant today. At that time researchers were still unsure as to what constitutes machine intelligence, and to a large degree the lack of a general definition has continued to this day. But one can argue with confidence that machine intelligence has finally taken a foothold in the real world, and in fact is now undergoing an explosion in application, particularly in areas such as network management, finance, medicine, and bioinformatics.The characterization of machine intelligence given in the paragraph above differs to a large degree to the classification of machine learning systems that is given in this book, but there are similarities. Since the time of publication of this book, emphasis now is placed on the ability of machines to solve problems in more than one domain. In particular, many insist that a truly intelligent machine must be able to use essentially the same reasoning patterns over multiple domains, or as a bare minimum that a reasoning pattern be able solve a problem in one domain and without alteration solve a different problem in a different domain.The editors of this book classify machine learning systems on the basis of the learning strategies that they use, the way that they represent the knowledge or skills that they acquire, and in terms of the domain in which the knowledge is acquired. It is interesting to note however that they distinguish the learning strategies by the amount of inference that the machine is able to perform. A machine that is programmed directly will not perform any inference, even though its knowledge increases. One could call these ordinary machines, and they represent most of the machines at the present time. However, there are at the present time machines that can discover new theories and invent new concepts. These machines the editors argue perform a substantial amount of inference, and therefore are less dependent on the need for tutoring or guidance by a teacher or the external environment. There are machines today that are certainly able to engage in this type of inference. Their reasoning patterns on based on inductive logic and they have been used in automated drug discovery. This book contains other examples of this type of learning, such as learning from examples and from instruction. The ability of some machines today to do this type of learning is a definite sign of the remarkable advances in machine intelligence since this volume was written.",Machine Learning,50.27
5,0070428077,"It's pretty well done, it covers theory and core areas but - maybe it was more the state of the field when it was written - I found it unsatisfyingly un-synthesized, unconnected, and short of detail (but this is subjective). I found the 2nd edition of Russell and Norvig to be a better introduction where it covers the same topic, which it does for everything I can think of, except VC dimension.The book sorely needs an update, it was written in 1997 and the field has moved fast. A comparison with Mitchell's current course (materials generously available online) shows that about 1/4 of the topics taught have arisen since the book was published; Boosting, Support Vector Machines and Hidden Markov Models to name the best-known. The book also does not cover statistical or data mining methods.Despite the subjective complaint about lack of depth it does give the theoretical roots and many fundamental techniques decently and readably. For many purposes though it may have been superceded by R&amp;N 2nd ed.",Machine Learning,50.27
6,0070428077,"I liked the book. But I think author must provide more figures in the book like Duda and Hart's Pattern Classification book. I used the book as master course and I found it easy to follow, interesting and useful book even I am newcomer to topic.",Machine Learning,50.27
7,0070428077,"This book is a redaction of many different white papers on the topic of machine learning. The material is very credible and accepted in the field, with very little (if any) temporal information (short term at least). With that said, it is also very dry and academic, and requires a solid background in mathematics to understand. Even if you are in the field, you're likely to read certain pages several times to embrace a concept... but once you embrace it, you will have some of the best foundational knowledge there is on the subject. If you're in the machine-learning field, you'll benefit from revisiting some of these subject, and probably learn a new thing or two.",Machine Learning,50.27
8,0070428077,"This is not my favorite machine learning book, but Tom Mitchell did us all a favor by writing it.  It covers the breadth of topics that make up the machine learning discipline fairly completely.  Since this book is about completely, there is also a shallowness, but that shallowness does not trim out complete descriptions of the algorithms covered.  Oh no, all the gory math is there, what isn't there are simple examples.My first time through the book, what gave me the biggest headache was trying to understand back propagation from the algorithm pseudo code and the proof of correctness.  I really really wanted one simple example at that point to make sure I understood the correct use of all the greek terms.So good book, but I really wanted ""Machine Learning Examples"" to go along with it back when I first picked it up.  But once you understand, the book is a great reference.",Machine Learning,50.27
9,0070428077,"Machine Learning by Tom M. Mitchell is the first text book for students who aspire to learn the subject of machine learning. It presents detailed and easy to understand illustrations of various concepts that are used in the field of machine learning. These include, necessary topics concerning probability and statistics, artificial intelligence, neural networks and evolutionary algorithms.The best thing about the book is its illustration of feed-forward, back-propagation, multi-layer perceptron (MLP). The good thing about it is that the underlying mathematical concepts are explained in a layman friendly manner. One learns techniques for computing partial derivatives and the chain rule for differentiation for the first time in high-school calculus without having any apparent and significant practical benefit. Their utility becomes clear when one reads and understands how the MLP works. More precisely, Mitchell explains how partial derivatives are computed with respect to the weight coefficients at every step of the MLP so as to guide the gradient descent algorithm to plunge into some locally or globally optimal solution. Similarly, Mitchell shows the significance of applying the chain rule to derive weight coefficients at every layer and node of the MLP with respect to the input values at its first layer. The whole explanation is quite fascinating and exciting.Mitchell also introduces and covers the complicated topic of evolutionary algorithms in a very nice way. Initially various concepts surrounding genetic algorithms are introduced in a lucid manner to make the student comfortable with the subject. Mitchell then illustrates genetic programming. Other important and interesting algorithms are also discussed. For instance, coverage of the famous simulated annealing algorithm is quite interesting. The book is an excellent guide for any student who has began to learn machine learning.",Machine Learning,50.27
10,0070428077,"I got this book from the university's library, because I wanted a nice book that can show me different methods for machine learning, so I can learn the buzzwords, and understand their meaning, at least in principle. It was important to me that the book won't go too much in depth into any subject, and more importantly, that the book won't use unfamiliar terminology, unless explained before.This book is indeed a nice overview of the field at the time it was written, although a lot happened in Machine Learning since, the book remains a good source for learning what can be done and how.Reading the book is quite easy (I'm a graduate student in computer science), and quickly I got what I was asking for.This book is not a magic pill for any problem. This is not a cookbook. So the compliments are in place as long as you know what you're looking for.These days I attend a seminar where the students are asked, each student in turn to present one chapter from this book (and some other books). Surely, once the seminar is over, we (the students) will know enough to be able to chat about Machine Learning, and more importantly, we will know where to look for deeper texts if we wanted to.",Machine Learning,50.27
11,0070428077,"This is extremely intuitive and general point of view on ML.good for quick reading and getting introduced to the topic.I'd recommend this to people starting ML.then move on to more mathematically rigorous and specific books such as""Pattern Classification""/ ""Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning"" / Hastie's ""Element of Statistical Learning""i never say this for a book. but it is too pricey for what it is offering.FYI i think they should increase the price of Chris Bishop's book.",Machine Learning,50.27
12,0070428077,"One of the best books on the subject. Mitchell gives a good introductory coverage to all aspects of Machine Learning. This is not a book full of mathematics, it is a book that gets across ideas and concepts.",Machine Learning,50.27
13,0070428077,"This book is completely worth the price, and worth the hardcover to take care of it. The main chapters of the book are independent, so you can read them in any order. The way it explains the different learning approaches is beautiful because:  1)it explains them nicely 2)it gives examples and 3)it presents pseudocode summaries of the algorithms. As a software developer, what else could I possibly ask for?",Machine Learning,50.27
14,0070428077,"It is very rare to find a text that both does rigorous justice to a subject, and also is an enjoyable read.  This book is such a rarity",Machine Learning,50.27
15,0070428077,"I have used this book during my masters and found it to be an extremely helpful and a gentle introduction to the thick and things of machine learning applications. The various chapters are nicely paced with helpful problems at the end. Another great thing about the book is treatment of detailed examples with each concept and that the author carefully ties various concepts as they arise, with not just new, but also examples from previous chapters, which helps the user to understand different concepts applied to same problems thereby making clear difference between different methods. Also the author has a dedicated website with updated errata and notes, which is also very helpful! Having said that, I think the book is an introduction to various machine learning methods and one can easily follow on the references listed for detailed treatment of relevant topics.",Machine Learning,50.27
16,0070428077,"First of all, the statistical part of machine learning is JUST a real subset of mathematical statisitcs, whatever Bayesian or frequentist. Secondly, the non-statistical part of machine learning is not systematic or well developed yet.We have used it as a textbook for a half-year course of Machine Learning. I think[1] this book is a collection of many methods from Pattern Recognition, Statistics, Coding Theory, etc.[2] anyone who wants to make clear the algorithms of EM, ME, etc, DO NOT read this book.[3] it is suitable for undergraduate students in light of its simple mathematics.[4] the examples in this book are very very naive.",Machine Learning,50.27
17,0070428077,"I agree with some of the previous reviews which criticize the book for its lack of depth, but I believe this to be an asset rather than a liability given its target audience (seniors and beginning grad. students). The average college senior typically knows very little about subjects like neural networks, genetic algorithms, or Baysian networks, and this book goes a long way in demystifying these subjects in a very clear, concise, and understandable way. Moreover, the first-year grad. student who is interested in possibly doing research in this field needs more of an overview than to dive deeply intoone of the many branches which themselves have had entire books written about them. This is one of the few if only books where one will find diverse areas of learning (e.g. analytical, reinforcment, Bayesian, neural-network, genetic-algorithmic) all within the same cover.But more than just an encyclopedic introduction, the author makes a number of connections between the different paradigms. For example, he explains that associated with each paradigm is the notion of an inductive-learning bias, i.e. the underlying assumptions that lend validity to a given learning approach. These end-of-chapter discussions on bias seem very interesting and unique to this book.Finally, I used this book for part of the reading material for an intro. AI class, and received much positive feedback from the students, although some did find the presentation a bit too abstract for their undergraduate tastes",Machine Learning,50.27
18,0070428077,"Given that this book was released in the mid 90's it should be outdated given the field that it is in, yet the book still provides a relevant overview of the major methods in the field of machine learning.",Machine Learning,50.27
19,0070428077,This book just breezes through all the machine learning concepts and does not go into any great details. It felt more like an index of learning techniques with a short summary on each.,Machine Learning,50.27
20,0070428077,"The book machine learning by Mitchell provides a systematic overview of important concepts in the field. This is rather rare finding because most books present first of all algorithms but fall short communicating systematic insights that would help the reader to creatively develop methods by themselves.It is needless to say that any book with the title 'machine learning' is inherent incomplete due to the incompletenss of the field itself. For this reason this book is not state of the art of current algrithms. Instead, again, concepts are at the center of focus.Overall, well writen and a very good selection of examples and explanations. I recommend this to anyone for a general overview.",Machine Learning,50.27
21,0071344446,"This book is valuable for 2 main reasons :- First, it is so rich in detail that it is an encyclopedia for Data Miner and CRM people. everything is described : tools, approaches, projects ...- Seconnd, an to me the  key point : it is the only book that truly integrate CRM, data warehouse  and data mining and still provide and intelligent reading !If you have a  project wuth such flavour, or before embarking a CRM project, read this  before the first meeting",Building Data Mining Applications for CRM,30.39
22,0071344446,"I really like Kurt Thearling's writing, in general--he has written some very clear and practical papers on data mining.  But I was badly disappointed by this book.  I should have guessed from the complex title that the book is merely an attempt to cash in on the current interest in &quot;customer relationship management&quot; or CRM.  In my opinion, CRM is not about data mining--see Dick Lee's book, The Customer Relationship Management Survival Guide, for a much more substantial treatment of CRM.  In trying to be a book about CRM, this volume also does a poor job explaining data mining techniques--I strongly recommend Linoff and Berry's second book, Mastering Data Mining, instead.  In short, I don't think that this is the book you want, no matter what you might be looking for.",Building Data Mining Applications for CRM,30.39
23,0071344446,"When I happen to read books like that I wonder whether my time has gone (er... from a cultural point of view, of course). You can find references to interesting subjects in the publication, but just references, and they are shown in a so elementary way that it makes the book suitable for absolute beginners, in data mining, data analysis, and computer science (i.e. first-job employees or financial executives). Walking along the sharp boundary between generality and triviality, the leading way slips many times down the latter side. A book of almost five hundred pages could have afforded to examine more deeply the relating subjects, avoiding repetitions (and sometimes to cut and paste) and the inflated style typical of slide shows. In my experience, this text is close to a lost opportunity, because the good general structure (a path from CRM basics to the most known tools), which I appreciated, has not been supported by a sufficient strength of linked subjects, leaving the book as similar as the skeleton structure of a not completed building. The book could be worth reading, but a reader facing five hundred pages would deserve more.",Building Data Mining Applications for CRM,30.39
24,0071344446,"This book assumes sufficient knowledge of data warehouse and CRM. This book deals purely with Data Mining - one of the branches of Business Intelligence.A very good book that includes chapters on business value and business case for an enterprise wide Data Mining solution. Certainly is helpful to me in my goals to pursue data mining solutions for clients.Good understanding of a &quot;profitable customer&quot; is a prerequisite for an enterprise wide data mining solution - which is emphasized in this book neatly.Can be used to educate marketing/sales/operations executives about data mining concepts and principles. Unless there's an executive buy-in, the concept will not sell in an organization. Business values and business case chapters will help one is selling this concept to higher-ups and help associates understand data mining in theory.My theory is that, data mining implementations would help organizations coming out of this economic mess, in reducing  marketing/sales/operating costs based on understanding the customer profitability and customer segmentation.

26,0120884070,"This book is perfect if you are trying to get your hands around what data mining and machine learning is.  Most of the books I have read on this subject want to start with equations and get more complex from there, with little practicality.  This book makes extensive use of examples and introduces the mathematical basis for algorithms where needed.  The authors make the point that simpler algoritms often work best for solving machine learning problems.  Similarly, I would argue, simpler books work best for understanding highly complex fields.  I very highly recommend this book.","Data Mining: Practical Machine Learning Tools and Techniques, Second Edition (Morgan Kaufmann Series in Data Management Systems)",13.85
27,0120884070,"The major virtue of this book is the emphasis on practical applications and bread-and-butter techniques for accomplishing tasks that one could expect in a business environment. That is not to say that these techniques could not be used in a scientific research environment. They indeed could be, and in fact may be even easier to implement due to the long time scales that are available in research environments for processing information. In the business world however data mining has proven to be an activity that gives a substantial competitive edge, and so many businesses are seeking even more sophisticated methods of data mining and Web mining. Data mining could easily be considered to a branch of artificial intelligence (AI), due to its emphasis on learning patterns and performing classification, and the learning and classification tools it uses were discovered by individuals who would describe themselves as being researchers in artificial intelligence. But many, and it is fair to include the authors of this book, do not want to view data mining as part of artificial intelligence, since the latter stirs up discussions on the origin of intelligence, autonomous robots, and conscious machines, to paraphrase a line from chapter 8 of this book. The authors make it a point to emphasize that data mining, or ""machine learning"" is concerned with the algorithms for the inference of structure from data and the validation of that structure.Along with its practical emphasis, the book includes discussions of some very interesting developments that are not usually included in books or monographs on data mining. One of these concerns the current research in `programming by demonstration.' This research is targeted towards the ""ordinary"" computer user who does not possess any programming knowledge but yet wants to automate predictable tasks. The only thing required from the user is knowledge of how to do the task in the usual way. As an example, the authors discuss briefly the `Familiar' system, which extracts information from user applications to make predictions and then generates explanations for the user about its predictions. Even more interesting is that it learns the tasks that are specialized for each individual user. It learns from the unique style of each user and their interaction history. One of the most interesting and powerful claims of programming by demonstration is that is domain-independent, considering the current intense interest in reasoning patterns or algorithms that can process information arising from multiple domains. In this regard a successful system would then be able to learn how to play chess from a user along with perhaps composing music. Again, the ability of a machine to reason in many domains is a step towards what many in the artificial community have called a `universal' learning machine. But the authors do not hold to this view, and in fact they open up the discussion in the chapter on the Weka workbench with a statement to the effect that there is no single learning algorithm that will work with all data mining problems. The ""universal learner"" they say, is an ""idealistic fantasy.""Another interesting discussion included in the book is that of `co-training', which is a methodology that arises in the context of `semi-supervised learning.' In this learning scheme the input contains both unlabeled and labeled data. In co-training, one depends on the fact that the classification task depends on two different and independent perspectives. Then assuming there are a few labeled examples, a different model will be learned for each perspective, and then the models are separately used to label the unlabeled examples. Each model will contribute both negative and positive examples to the pool of labeled examples. The procedure is then repeated until the unlabeled pool is empty. This allows both models to be trained on the new pool of labeled examples. The authors point out some evidence indicating that if a (naive) Bayesian learner is used throughout this procedure, then it outperforms a learner that develops a single model from the labeled data. The intuition behind this is that using the independence of the two perspectives allows one to reduce the likelihood of an incorrect labeling. References are given for readers that want to investigate this approach in more detail, along with more brief discussions on its generalizations, such as co-EM, which involves probabilistic labeling of unlabeled data in one perspective, and how to use support vector machines in place of the naive Bayesian learner.For the practitioner, the most useful discussion in the book concerns the evaluation of the different methods for data mining. What makes one approach to data mining better than another, and is there then a ranking of the different approaches? Can one in fact make judgments on the reliability or performance of data mining algorithms using solely the training or test data? If one had a general methodology for ranking data mining algorithms according to their performance then this would be a major advance, since this would allow a classification scheme for machine learning where one could speak of one machine being `more intelligent' than another. Unfortunately however this is difficult, and even said to be impossible according to some researchers. There are results in the research literature, going by the name of `free lunch' theorems, which seem to indicate that one cannot distinguish machine learning algorithms based solely on the way the deal with training or test data. The authors do not discuss these results in this book, but it is certainly apparent that they are aware of the difficult issues involved in the prediction of performance for data mining algorithms.","Data Mining: Practical Machine Learning Tools and Techniques, Second Edition (Morgan Kaufmann Series in Data Management Systems)",13.85

I had been reading numerous Wikipedia articles, scientific papers, etc. on line and felt it would be useful to have a more general tome on the subject. This book covers many of the common, overarching themes i.e. clustering, neural networks, linear regression, etc. to varing degree. I only wish the examples involved slightly more complex data sets and more pseudo code was provided. I suppose since the book is very closely tied to WEKA, one could always dig through the source code of that application; but I feel that the authors could have provided a bit more of the strictly algorithm relevant code in the book.","Data Mining: Practical Machine Learning Tools and Techniques, Second Edition (Morgan Kaufmann Series in Data Management Systems)",13.85
29,0120884070,"This book is very easy to read and understand. Unlike Hastie's Statistical Learning book, it is not geared towards those with an expert level knowledge of statistics, and instead takes time to explain functions and formulas for the person with a decent but not extrordinary understanding of statistical/math concepts. For example, their description of a Gaussian was the clearest I've seen. On the other hand, if you're math/statistics background is considerable, you may find this book somewhat simplistic or tedious.The book has a good coverage of techniques and algorithms, although I was somewhat disappointed that they do not mention Influence Diagrams, considering the amount of coverage of both decision trees and Bayesian techniques. Their discussion of Combining Multiple Models, however, is well done, and is not covered to this extent in most books I've seen. I also like how they broke out the discussion of input and output (knowledge representation) into their own chapters.Addendum 10/30: After reading a good hunk of this book I still agree with most of what I said earlier, but I do think the authors could have gone into graphical models a lot more. At the end of the discussion on Bayesian networks, Markov networks and other graphical models are mentioned very briefly and the author says they are very big in ML right now, but he doesn't say why they didn't describe them further. It might have something to do with the organization of the book. Graphical models almost need a chapter of their own but the book's chapters discuss all techniques in one chapter but with varying levels of detail.","Data Mining: Practical Machine Learning Tools and Techniques, Second Edition (Morgan Kaufmann Series in Data Management Systems)",13.85

All major data mining topics are covered, though in a necessarily shallow manner in keeping with the book's goal of getting past the theory and moving to the practice.Oddly, the very start of the book does have a bit of theory in the form of the historical roots of statistics and the limitations of statistics that leads to the need for data mining; I found this bit of history quite fascinating and enlightening; it is something I've found in few other data mining books, and I've read several.The trouble is, I do like theory a bit.  I have a master's in computer science, so I'm a bit biased that way, thus my relatively low scoring of the work.About 1/3rd of the book is dedicated to working through real problems, and that is the overwhelming strength of the book.  If you are one who learns by doing rather than by theorizing, you'll find this book outstanding.The biggest criticism I have of the book is that it is clear that there are significant parts where the authors just didn't have their hearts in it; it felt like they wrote certain sections because the publisher told them they had to in order to hit some type of target marketing segment.It's also unfortunate that all three software products provided expire in 90 days or less.  I'm never one to accomplish anything in 90 days, let alone get through a 700-page technical work!!!  I know they are the 3 top mining tools, but I much prefer RapidMiner, a product that is amazingly feature-rich, so easy to use it is actually fun, supported by a robust open-source model, and free.Overall, a solid work.  But to me, theory matters, that's one star down; and rigorous, enthusiastic writing matters, so that's two stars down.  In the 3-stars that remain is lots of hands-on practice if you don't mind expiring software, and for that it is very strong.",Handbook of Statistical Analysis and Data Mining Applications,26.75
39,0123747651,"The ""Handbook of Statistical Analysis & Data Mining Applications"" is the finest book I have seen on the subject.  It is not only a beautifully crafted book, with numerous color graphs, chart, tables, and screen shots, but the statistical discussion is both clear and comprehensive.The text does not use only one statistical data mining application to display examples, but provides a rather thorough training in the use of both SAS-Enterprise Miner  and STATISTICA Data Miner.  A section on SPSS Clementine is also provided, giving comparisons between the various packages. Also employed are STATISTICA's C&RT;, CHAID,  MARSpline, and other data mining and graphical analytic tools.The text does not burden the typical data mining researcher with the internals of how the various tools work. It is therefore not steeped in equations. Some are to be found, of course, but the emphasis is on understanding the concepts involved and on how to apply these concepts to real data - which is provided to the reader in terms of data tutorials. Specialized datasets have been prepared by both authors and outside experts in various areas of inquiry ranging from entertainment, financial, engineering, clinical psychology, dentistry, demographics, medical informatics, meteorology, astronomy, and more.  Each tutorial is associated with data stored on either the associated CD that comes with the book, or which can be downloaded from a companion web site.  Worked out examples of how to use data mining techniques on such data is provided to help the reader gain a solid feel for the data mining enterprise.  The final third of the book is devoted to a partial selection of the available tutorials. The two earlier chapters demonstrate how to use data mining software for the analysis of data.I highly recommend this work to anyone having an interest in data mining. I might also add that the Amazon price of $72.37 is truly excellent for an 864 page academic text, having full color tables and screen shots on some one-third of the pages, plus a CD. A bargain indeed.",Handbook of Statistical Analysis and Data Mining Applications,26.75
40,0123747651,"The book from Robert Nisbet, John Elder and Gary Miner is a fresh addition to any data miner library. First surprise: the book is in full colors with a lot of pictures which is a good point. With a focus on data mining applications, the book also covers introduction and more profound data mining concepts. The book isn't very technical and doesn't contain equations and complex formulas. However, complex data mining challenges are addressed. The main advantage of the book is to give examples of each concept using three famous data mining tools: SPSS, SAS and STATISTICA.The biggest added value of the book, and what makes it a unique resource in the field, are the tutorials. Several applications are detailed: aviation safety, unsatisfied customers, credit scoring and process control among others. Whatever your field of application is, you will find useful examples in the book. Even if the case studies aren't in your field of interest, reading them takes you to an amazing journey in the world of analytics.To be noted the interesting chapters about text mining and fraud detection. In the last part of the book, five chapters provide expert advices to both beginners and experienced data miners. The chapter ""Top 10 Data Mining Mistakes"" is remarkable. To conclude, this book is about applying data mining, rather than programming it. It gives excellent examples of enterprise applications in analytics.",Handbook of Statistical Analysis and Data Mining Applications,26.75

42,0123748569,"This book is great if you want to learn about data mining to find new relationships within your dataset.  It covers the important introductory concepts, including basic rule inference, Bayesian, and clustering, albeit somewhat briefly for those unfamiliar with the topic.Last time I used Weka was 6 or 7 years ago, at which point some of its algorithm implementations could easily be outperformed by coding them yourself (e.g. Bayesian).  However, it more quite user friendly for folks who wanted to focus on the outcome/output rather than coding.  The final section of this book is like an extensive user manual that Weka was sorely lacking back then.Overall, given that this book not only explains the concepts, but also how to use software to perform the data mining operations, this book fills a void that existed.","Data Mining: Practical Machine Learning Tools and Techniques, Third Edition (The Morgan Kaufmann Series in Data Management Systems)",20.99

44,0123748569,"Fantastic book if you need to use WEKA; probably the best recommendation available.If, however, you're not going to be using WEKA then the book is still valuable, but I challenge the true 'practicality' of it. The content is thorough but perhaps more academically oriented than as industry focused as I would have liked. The author keeps it very accessible, particularly as far as mathematics and statistics go. While this might make the book a little more long winded - in my view it makes it a far easier to get into the groove and allows you to read it like a book.* Highly recommended for WEKA users* For others users I suggest you look through to see if it will really be helpful before plunking down the cash","Data Mining: Practical Machine Learning Tools and Techniques, Third Edition (The Morgan Kaufmann Series in Data Management Systems)",20.99
45,0123748569,"I have the second edition of Data Mining, but would like to put in a good word for the book, and hope to get the new issue soon. (I hope to say more in the future.) I have been a data miner, and am in awe of the potential of this modern technology.What is Data Mining? As the authors explain it, it is more than a stored data warehouse of searchable data, or of a database of like-information. It enables enhanced knowledge to develop from data or from experts' behavior (assuming there is a data record of such) and it could be described as a form of knowledge management, with machine learning, the assistance of machines, as a critical component. Sure you could compile spreadsheets or matrices by hand also.This is really the only good book on the topic that I know of. Other sources for this topic are the academic journals. The good thing is this book gets you to work, using the WEKA system that the authors developed, and offer for free.","Data Mining: Practical Machine Learning Tools and Techniques, Third Edition (The Morgan Kaufmann Series in Data Management Systems)",20.99
46,0123748569,"This handbook provides an excellent overview of Data Mining and Machine Learning Techniques, and is written by 3 distinguished Lecturers/Professors of Computer Science in New Zealand.  As difficult a topic as Statistical Machine Learning ordinarily requires an advanced knowledge of Linear Algebra, and Statistics.  By relying heavily on verbal descriptions and illustrations from the Open Source (JAVA-based) package WEKA package the authors have made this important and extremely useful (consider the wide mention of Analytics in the business press) fairly understandable.  The heavy emphasis on WEKA (perhaps 30-40% of the book in this edition) is both a strength and weakness of the book; it sometimes provides excellent verbal description and illustrations; but a times feels like a user manual for WEKA.This is a generally understandable introduction and commentary on a vital and sometimes difficult topic. My only minor criticism is that the book contains limited descriptions of Neural Networks andSupport Vector Machines, two important Machine Learning methods in current use.--Ira Laefsky","Data Mining: Practical Machine Learning Tools and Techniques, Third Edition (The Morgan Kaufmann Series in Data Management Systems)",20.99
47,0123748569,"This is an excellent text. The authors early on define data mining ""as the extraction of implicit, previously unknown and potentially useful information from data"". The techniques, methodologies and algorithms for achieving this goal are the crux of this 600 page text.It is grindingly thorough and only the dedicated will make it through the book without assistance. For those who do, they will have an excellent grounding in the theory and basic techniques of machine learning. The last third of the book introduces WEKA. WEKA is an open-source workbench that permits the data mining student to try out all the algorithms presented in the book. It's free and extensible.The reader needs a pretty good grasp of database technology and more than a little knowledge of statistics and math. The latter is not an absolute necessity, but will make comprehending this material a faster and easier process.The authors, collectively, has a clear writing style, free of academic cant. If you take it slow, everything ultimately becomes clear.Overall, this is an excellent introduction to data mining, but is not for those who expect to learn even the fundamentals of this technology in a few days time.

48,0123748569,"This is my first read through a technical text on data mining.  Despite only having experience with more general programming, math and statistical analysis, I found the material approachable.  While the text caters well to the novice, there is substantial detail and enough content for the practitioner, which is what I'm aiming for.The content is organized into 3 sections: basic concepts, advanced concepts, and WEKA.  The organization was a major strength of the text and I was glad to have more advanced material put off for the 2nd section while I was still familiarizing myself with basic terms and methodology.  The final section covers WEKA - which is a free, publicly licensed software tool capable of grinding out what you are learning in the book.Overall, Data Mining exceeded my expectations.  It covered all the topics I hoped it would, like predictive modeling, regression, recursion, noise, logic tres, efficiency, etc.  While I am only a novice, I can easily recommend this book to anyone looking for a catchall on this subject egardless of knowledge.","Data Mining: Practical Machine Learning Tools and Techniques, Third Edition (The Morgan Kaufmann Series in Data Management Systems)",20.99
49,0123748569,"This is a good text on machine learning techniques from both the statistics and the machine learning perspectives.  The authors note that these fields have developed in parallel with many researchers and practitioners working in each, but few familiar with the full range of techniques in both disciplines.  Some procedures, such as tree induction and nearest neighbor clustering techniques, have been developed independently in both fields.  However, for the most part statistics has focused on hypothesis testing and machine learning has tried to optimize search through the space of possible hypotheses.  This book presents techniques from both traditions.The organizational structure of the book supports its use as either a comprehensive text or a modular reference.  The first section's five chapters introduce the foundations of data mining.  In addition to concepts and definitions, there are simple example data sets and accessible descriptions of how both raw data and final analyses are used in this field.  A particularly well-written fifth chapter discusses how to evaluate data mining models.  It discusses the rationale for holdout samples, the use of cross-validation procedures, and how to avoid over-fitting models.  Machine learning texts frequently lack depth on this topic while statistics texts often fail to communicate the consequences of poorly-fitted models.  This integration of perspectives is a good one.Chapters in the second section build on this foundation.  Chapter 6 describes how to use ten different techniques to detect and describe patterns in large data sets.  This section also describes how to prepare data for data mining, how to combine and transform variables to increase model accuracy, and how to improve prediction by combining different model types using bagging, boosting, and other aggregation techniques.  A final chapter outlines directions of current and future research expanding our toolbox of techniques.  The eight chapters of the third and final section are a detailed tutorial covering the Weka workbench of machine learning algorithms and data transformation tools.This book has several communication strengths.  The scope is broad for an introductory text.  The Further Readings collections at each chapter's end are reasonably brief and point to current and in-depth sources.  The text itself contains numerous example analyses and follows the useful strategy of analyzing the same data with several techniques.  Its review of algorithms and formulas focuses on explaining how they work rather than on deriving them from general principles.  A key strength is the book's close integration with Weka.  This ensures that readers can step through analysis procedures, experiment with variations from default paths, and compare the performance of different formulations of the same research problems.I recommend the book for readers introducing themselves to machine learning.  It will take some of your time to learn the techniques and practice using them in Weka, but it will be time well spent.  Don't skip the Weka section!","Data Mining: Practical Machine Learning Tools and Techniques, Third Edition (The Morgan Kaufmann Series in Data Management Systems)",20.99
50,0123748569,"Good:Provides a good overview of the field as well as basic concepts in everyday language. It tries to explain any jargon that it introduces. I'm going to disagree with a reviewer. The book is not WEKA focused and is useful for people even if they are not going to use WEKA. Even if the book had a strong focus on WEKA, I don't see what's wrong given that WEKA is free and open source and widely used for machine learning and data mining. I'll elaborate more on this subject in the Bad section.Provides both overviews as well as more detailed discussions (such as potential applications) related to various types of commonly used algorithms. I felt the diagrams it presents were key to understanding the concepts.Applies the concepts using a library called WEKA.Bad:I didn't think the book focused enough on application. It's great to learn theory, but personally I don't learn a subject very well if I don't have enough opportunities to apply it. I totally disagree with another reviewer. I felt that the book should have had MORE content related to WEKA. Yes, WEKA is free and open source but there is so little documentation written on it compared to other Java libraries and frameworks. More content on it would have been better since there isn't a definitive book on it that didn't solely focus on the GUI application portion of WEKA. Besides there are plenty of other good books that focus on data mining and machine learning. This is the only one for WEKA.","Data Mining: Practical Machine Learning Tools and Techniques, Third Edition (The Morgan Kaufmann Series in Data Management Systems)",20.99
51,0123748569,"I grabbed this book because I am in epidemiology and biostatistics, and am always looking for ways to apply what's been learned in other fields to how we work with data here. There's a lot of amazing advances in data mining and in machine learning especially, so this looked like an interesting book.And truthfully, I did find about 10-15% of this book incredibly useful and interesting, and I'll be keeping it on my bookshelf for that alone.  But large chunks of the book were focused solely on using Weka (which we don't use here) or in describing data modeling techniques (which I was already well versed in).The parts of this book that I did find useful were those that focused on how to take those data modeling techniques and actually use them in a machine learning context. The way the book is set up makes it hard to just swoop through and pick those parts out, though -- which meant that I spent more time than I'd like weeding through the information I already knew to find the new and useful bits. That said, I'm not really the target audience for this book, which means that I keep coming back to it hoping that it will be something it isn't meant to be. And for what it is, I think it does a good job, although I think the utility would have been broadened somewhat if it wasn't so very focused on Weka users.","Data Mining: Practical Machine Learning Tools and Techniques, Third Edition (The Morgan Kaufmann Series in Data Management Systems)",20.99
52,0123748569,"The subtitle of the book should really be emphasized more:  Practical Machine Learning Tools and Techniques.  This isn't a book about adhoc SQL queries and database statistics, it is about tools to discover relationships you didn't know you were looking for.  Much of the book shows how to handle knowledge formation and representation, statistical modeling and projections.  The one critique I have in regard is that much of the algorithm breakdowns are done in prose rather than true pseudocode.I would like to echo other reviews that point out the text focuses on WEKA, and the authors indicate this is by intent.  Though they do give much generic information, at some point you have to pick a horse to hitch your carriage to, and an established open-source project in Java is probably most widely accessible.  Their coverage of WEKA claims 50% more features than the 2nd ed. and indeed it consumes half the book.  I feel this is a good thing, as it lends great practicality to the book, allowing you to dig right in and get something actually done.There are some additions to the 3rd ed. that modernize the book a bit.  Showing how data can be reidentified (and the ethical implications) is pertinent to today's HIPAA-regulated medical environments.

53,0123748569,"There exists a couple of classics of Machine learning, with various strengths and weaknesses. ""The elements of statistical learning"" by Hastie and company. Bishop's book, ""Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning."" And now, this book, ""Data Mining."" I'd say this is the most practical of the three books. The other two I mentioned are oriented towards theoretical underpinnings, and cataloging the rich zoology of machine learning techniques. This one tells you how to get stuff done. Lots of practical ideas on discretization, denoising, data preparation and  performance characterization. It even has practical advice on things you really need an expert opinion on: for example, when using data folding techniques for cross validation ... what is a good number of folds to use? This book will tell you. It's like having a couple of seasoned experts looking over your shoulder when you're trying to get things done. It had a detailed recipe in it for something I really needed to solve... and their recipe worked!While the subject matter is similar to the Bishop and Hastie books: what this most reminded me of was the classic physics text, ""Numerical recipes."" It's all very well having a good theoretical understanding of the techniques you're using. It's vastly more important to have advice on using them properly. This is that book; uniquely so, thus far, in my experience.It's also a brilliant manual for their Weka machine learning environment, which is incredibly useful. I don't use the Weka UI, but I have called upon Weka as a library extension to the R programming environment. Mostly because of this book: it's both a recipe book and a map to a large collection of recipes you can use to solve your machine learning problems.There isn't so much on time series applications, sadly, which is something I end up working with a lot. I'd love to see an extended chapter on the particular difficulties in using machine learning techniques to mine and forecast time series.","Data Mining: Practical Machine Learning Tools and Techniques, Third Edition (The Morgan Kaufmann Series in Data Management Systems)",20.99

55,0123748569,"I've had (the first edition of) this book for a while now, and when I first read it some years ago, I thought that it was very comprehensive but written in a mind-numbing dry style. Fast forward a few years, during which I have (a) used some Machine Learning toolkits (including Weka) to solve real problems and (b) attended the Weka MOOC and re-read this book as part of the suggested readings in the class, and now I suddenly find it full of interesting insights and advice that I missed earlier.I think this book would be most useful for an intermediate level data mining professional who uses or adapts existing algorithms to solve problems (as opposed to someone in academia who builds completely new algorithms), but who needs to know the functionality and rationale behind each of the algorithms to effectively use them. This extends to not only the main algorithms for classification, clustering, association rule mining, etc, but also to algorithms for feature selection, preprocessing, etc. The book really comes into its own if you are also using the Weka toolkit - since the book is based on Weka, you can try things out for yourself to visually understand the concepts presented in the book. Weka has a very comprehensive coverage for various algorithms, provides a GUI and a CLI, can be called directly from the command line via java, can be embedded within your Java (or other JVM based language) program, and can also handle big data using its streaming algorithms, so its a good toolkit to learn and use. At the same time, the book has a solid focus on core Machine Learning concepts as well, so the knowledge you gain using Weka and this book is transferrable to other toolkits in the future.","Data Mining: Practical Machine Learning Tools and Techniques, Third Edition (The Morgan Kaufmann Series in Data Management Systems)",20.99
56,0123748569,"The authors write at a good level of sophistication. Aimed at a reader already expected to have a strong maths background and computing experience. In university terms, you probably need to be a junior level undergraduate or higher. The attraction of the text is that it explains well the gist of many computationally important methods in machine learning. The algorithms are covered in enough detail that you should for example be able to understand and intelligently use any software package that implements them. Or even to write code from scratch to instantiate an algorithm.To give you an idea of the book's comprehensiveness, these are some of the explicated ideas - support vector machines, linear models, Bayesian models, multilayer perceptrons, clustering and ensemble learning. There are complete books devoted to each topic [and other topics in this text], that furnish far more details. But maybe ironically, those often can bury the reader in a mass of lower level details. This book will let you quickly understand at a high level the basic intent and logic behind those algorithms.The choice of explaining Weka takes up the last third of the book. While some readers might decry this, Weka seems like a reasonable choice of a software package to illuminate in some detail. In part, this lets you see an implementation of some of the ideas in the earlier portions of the book.

I have nothing against WEKA, and it is a good choice for a text such as this, since WEKA is free.  In my opinion, though, this coverage consumes too many pages of this book.- Data mining draws from a number of fields with separate roots (statistics, machine learning, pattern recognition, engineering, etc.), and many techniques go by multiple names.

The three stars are due to the fact that I am using the electronic version, on a kindle app on an Android tablet, and it has some issues.  It is mostly OK but suffers because quite a lot of the technical material is scanned rather than true font or vector which means that if you zoom in, the surrounding text gets bigger but the figures, formula and diagrams often don't.  This is particularly troublesome for mathematical formulas which are sometimes scanned at quiet low resolution and very difficult to decipher, not great when they are already quite complex to understand.It's usable though, much more convenient in electronic form and I've saved myself about $50 by renting the book on Amazon for four months compared to buying it at the Uni bookshop.","Data Mining: Concepts and Techniques, Third Edition (The Morgan Kaufmann Series in Data Management Systems)",22.5

The book's focus is on technique (i.e., how to analyze data, including preparation), and it addresses all the major topics in the field including data storage and pre-processing. However, the book is really about classification methods, and the 2 chapters on cluster analysis are particularly strong and thorough.For those looking for specific examples, applications, and domain knowledge, I would recommendData Mining Techniques: For Marketing, Sales, and Customer Relationship Managementby Linoff & Berry.

69,0201157675,"This is the only book I have read about Genetic algorithms, but it seems that it covers the field pretty well.In the preface it says that it is aimed a beginning graduate students, and since I have a M.Sc. in Computer Science and I just wanted to read it for fun I thought it would be for me. But I found that it uses way to many words to explain very basic things (e.g. almost a page to explain binary numbers) while many of the difficult equations just was presented without proper proof. So the book could have better if it had been cut down to a third and then supplemented with the proper proofs. So if you are a Computer Science graduate I cannot recommend this book. Given the fine books that Addison-Wesley usually publish I was quite disappointed with this one.But if you are a student in other fields and just want an ""intuitive"" impression of Genetic Algorithms without the mathematical rigor it is probably good.Chapter 1: An introduction to genetic algorithms with examples. This chapter is excellent.Chapter 2: The mathematical theory behind genetic algorithms. This is not done very well since many of the equations isn't proven or explained properly.Chapter 3: A Pascal program for the sample in chapter 1. This seems unneccesary since any proficient programmer easily could have implemented the program based on the information in chapter 1.Chapter 4: The history of genetic algorithms and a number of applications all taken from research. Both seem unneccesary.Chapter 5: An extension of the techniques presented in chapter 1. This is good.Chapter 6-7: Introduction to machine learning.

The underlying mathematics are explained in a very accessible manner, yet with enough rigor to fully explain the &quot;partial schemata&quot; theory which is so  important to understanding when and where GenAlgs can be applied. It is the  lack of coverage of this theory which causes so much misunderstanding and  disappointment in the power of genetic algorithms.But beyond the  background math (which makes up a small part of the book) this is really a  tutorial on implementing GenAlgs, and it is an excellent one. The sample  code is great, and the implementations are developed throughout the book,  allowing the reader to implement simple (but functional) algorithms after  reading only the first few chapters, but building to very sophisticated and  modern techniques by the end of the book.A great find.","Genetic Algorithms in Search, Optimization, and Machine Learning",15.53

The author is a pioneering authority on the subject and has explained the basics of a GA in a very gentle and easy to understand manner. The book has a great variety of specific but diverse examples, which may not be useful at first glance, but gives an insight to where all the technique has been applied!However, some aspects of the book perhaps need an edition, like the more recent advances in GA operators, specifics of chromosomal representation schemes, non-linear optimization functions, etc. I have read several, well written books on the subject, but this one has a very distinct and sometimes interesting style of writing! The best would be to quickly read this one to get a fairly good understanding of the basics and then take up a recent book that addresses other aspects like Mitchell's book, for example.Having said that, I think the book is a great and inspiring start to using genetic algorithms.","Genetic Algorithms in Search, Optimization, and Machine Learning",15.53

The professor is very old-school and still uses overhead projectors and hands out paper notes instead of something like PDF.The book is definitely dated here in 2013, but the ideas presented therein are valid. I would look elsewhere for a modern genetic algorithms book, though. Unless your professor is old-school and has textbooks older than you are.The code examples are largely irrelevant: nobody uses Pascal anymore, not even for teaching. So if you want to play along and run the code you either need to locate an old 386 and CRT monitor, or translate the code into something that actually runs in this century.","Genetic Algorithms in Search, Optimization, and Machine Learning",15.53

Genetic Algorithms are a great programming tool, and there are some tips and tricks that can help your programs converge faster and more accurately, but this book had a lot of redundant information.If you are interested in using GA for solution-finding, I doubt you'll find much useful in this book beyond the first chapter or so.  Many of the examples later in the book were so specific that I couldn't see how they could be usefully generalized.  Really optimizing a GA approach for a specific problem domain takes a fair amount of tuning, and this book won't help much with that.I think time spent surfing siteseer or other publication sites would be better spent than reading this book.","Genetic Algorithms in Search, Optimization, and Machine Learning",15.53

77,026201243X,"This semester I am taking a class on statistical learning theory where we prove bounds on various learning algorithms and I came to realize that I did not know all of the methods that we were proving bounds on.  To bring myself up to speed, I picked up this book.  Having had only minimal exposure to the algorithms that underlie machine learning, I found this introduction to be very useful.  It starts with a concise, but by no means terse review of basic statistics which lays the foundation for the rest of the book.  If you struggle to get through this review, or if it is new material, this may not be the book for you.  I should say that the author does not shy away from using equations, but does not use them gratuitously either.  He also does a reasonable job of not only explaining the steps that may not be intuitive as well as giving some motivation for what the equations actually mean.After reading this book, I can actually say that I have a much deeper understanding of many the algorithms discussed.  I found the exposition on principle component analysis (PCA) to be very enlightening (I have come across PCA in my work and had not previously found an explanation that I could understand) and the whole chapter on dimensionality reduction fascinating.  The chapters that discuss clustering and kernel methods were also good.  Also, the way that each chapter, which roughly corresponds to a single method, first focuses on the way the algorithm can be used for classification and then the more general case of regression was well thought out.This book does have some drawbacks though.  For instance, there are many careless typos in some chapters, making you wonder if they just forgot to proofread these chapters.  Even more infuriating, I am fairly certain that I came across at least one equation that was misprinted.  After just one wrong equation, you start to question the veracity of every one which you do not fully comprehend.  Also, I must say that I still only vaguely understand how a multilayer percetron works even though it is a major focus of the book.  Also, the chapter on Bayesian estimation was hard to follow.All in all, I think this book is well worth the price and that if you devote the time needed to read it you will learn a lot.",Introduction to Machine Learning (Adaptive Computation and Machine Learning series),48.12

87,0262193981,"As a subfield of artificial intelligence, reinforcement learning has shown great success from both a theoretical and practical viewpoint. Taking the form of numerous applications in finance, network engineering, robot toys, and games, it is clear that his learning paradigm shows even greater promise for future developments. The authors summarize the foundations of reinforcement learning, some of this coming from their own work over the last decade.The authors define reinforcement learning as learning how to map situations to actions so as to maximize a numerical reward. The machine that is indulging in reinforcement learning discovers on its own which actions will optimize the reward by trying out these actions. It is the ability of such a machine to learn from experience that distinguishes it from one that is indulging in supervised learning, for in the latter examples are needed to guide the machine to the proper concept or knowledge. The authors emphasize the ""exploration-exploitation"" tradeoffs that reinforcement-learning machines have to deal with as they interact with the environment.For the authors, a reinforcement learning system consists of a `policy', a `reward function', a `value function', and a `model' of the environment. A policy is a mapping from the states of the environment that are perceived by the machine to the actions that are to be taken by the machine when in those states. The reward function maps each perceived state of the environment to a number (the reward). A value function specifies what is the good for the machine over the long run. A model, as the name implies, is a representation of the behavior of the environment. The authors emphasize that all of the reinforcement learning methods that are discussed in the book are concerned with the estimation of value functions, but they point out that other techniques are available for solving reinforcement learning problems, such as genetic algorithms and simulated annealing.The authors use dynamic programming, Monte Carlo simulation, and temporal-difference learning to solve the reinforcement learning problem, but they emphasize that each of these methods will not give a free-lunch. An entire chapter is devoted to each of these methods however, giving the reader a good overview of the weaknesses and strengths of each of these approaches. The differences between them usual boil down to issues of performance rather than accuracy in the generated solutions. Temporal difference learning in fact is viewed in the book as a combination of Monte Carlo and dynamic programming techniques, and in the opinion of this reviewer, has resulted in some of the most impressive successes for applications based on reinforcement learning. One of these is TD-Gammon, developed to play backgammon, and which is also discussed in the book.The authors emphasize that these three main strategies for solving reinforcement learning problems are not mutually exclusive. Instead each of them could be used simultaneously with the others, and they devote a few chapters in the book illustrating how this ""unified"" approach can be advantageous for reinforcement learning problems. They do this by using explicit algorithms and not just philosophical discussion. These discussions are very interesting and illustrate beautifully the idea that there is no ""free lunch"" in any of the different algorithms involved in reinforcement learning.In the last chapter of the book the authors overview some of the more successful applications of reinforcement learning, one of them already mentioned. Another one discussed is the `acrobot', which is a two-link, underactuated robot, which models to some extent the motion of a gymnast on a high bar. The motion of the acrobot is to be controlled by swinging its tip above the first joint, with appropriate rewards given until this goal is reached. The authors use the `Sarsa' learning algorithm, developed earlier in the book, for solving this reinforcement learning problem. The acrobot is an example of the current intense interest in machine learning of physical motion and intelligent control theory.Another example discussed in this chapter deals with the problem of elevator dispatching, which the authors include as an example of a problem that cannot be dealt with efficiently by dynamic programming. This problem is studied with Q-learning and via the use of a neural network trained by back propagation.The authors also treat a problem of great importance in the cellular phone industry, namely that of dynamic channel allocation. This problem is formulated as a semi-Markov decision problem, and reinforcement learning techniques were used to minimize the probability of blocking a call. Reinforcement learning has become very important in the communications industry of late, as well as in queuing networks.",Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction (Adaptive Computation and Machine Learning),58.49

89,0262193981,"I have this book more than a year now and I am going through it for the second time, so I think I have a pretty good picture about it.The book consists of three parts.  In the first part, ""The Problem"", the authors define the scope of issues reinfocement learning is dealing with and they give some interesting introductory examples.  Then, they move on to the concept of evaluative feedback and, eventually, define the reinforcement learning problem formally.The second part, ""Elementary Solution Methods"" consists of three more-less independent subparts: Dynamic Programming, Monte Carlo Methods and Temporal Difference Learning.  All three fundamental reinforcement learning methods are presented in an interesting way and using good examples.  Personally, I liked the TD-Learning part best and I agree that this method is indeed the central method and an original contribution of reinforecement learning to the field of machine learning.The third part, ""A Unified View"" present more advanced techniques.  The last chapter gives the most important case studies in reinforcement learning including Samuel's Checkers Player and Thesauro's TD-Gammon.The book is very readable and every chapter ends with illustrative exercises (many of them actually are real programming projects!), always useful summary and very valuable bibliographical and historical remarks.  Some subchapters are more advanced and therefore marked with '*'.  I really recommend first two parts to any student ofd computer science or anyone interested in machine learning and fuzzy computing.

I missed this paraphrase most in the rule based systems; it felt like the chapter didn't relate itself much with the broad horizon of rule based systems yet provided a concrete implementation of one.Like author said ""I challenge every developer who reads the book to go out and find some product or technology to make your application better"", I believe its a must-have book for developers / computer scientists who want to integrate cutting edge enhanced computing technologies in their code without spending too much time in R&D; labs; MSR (research.microsoft.com) does it all for them and yes, you can participate.","Building Intelligent .NET Applications: Agents, Data Mining, Rule-Based Systems, and Speech Processing",20.56

94,0321246268,"I recently purchased this book on Amazon.  As an experienced .NET software developer, I am always keen on books that will expand my knowledge base in this area, and AI has been a particular interest of mine lately.  Having read through much of the book, I have found it very disappointing.  I would sum it up as a very shallow introduction to AI topics (often referred to as ""Narrow AI"") such as Data Mining.  This book is more a manual on how to use Microsoft technologies, and does not include anywhere near the depth or practical examples needed on the subjects presented.  I have personally found better info online.This book exclusively discussed MS products.  If these are the items the author wishes to discuss that is fine, but I was disappointed in the depth at which the products she included were discussed.  A good example is the MS Speech API.  The author discusses setting up the speech services in an ASP page via Visual Studio, but does not go into any real code.  How do you write custom code for this API?  How do you implement this in a WinForm where speech would seem to make much better sense?  Many sections of the book avoid actual code and focus on screen shots of wizards and configuration tools.The book did do a decent enough job of listing the technologies that MS has made available to .NET programmers.  However, I believe that the author almost sugar-coated the MS stuff.  Where are the downsides of these APIs, servers and tools?  Where are the pitfalls that a programmer should avoid or watch for when implementing agents or data mining or speech services with these MS technologies?  As an MCSD, MCT and as an experienced developer that has used a few generations of Microsoft software development tools, I know that with each of their technologies, there are hidden problems (like any vendor's software).  The author does not impart any real level of knowledge of the practical usage of the technologies at hand.  In fact, the book is left with a feel that a competent Microsoft technical writer could have written the book by simply copying-and-pasting documentation from various MS product lines.I give the book 2 starts instead of one as there are a couple of gems in the book that I think I will use.

98,0321321367,"Data mining could be considered to be ""Artificial Intelligence Lite"", since it deals with many of the same issues in learning, classification, and analysis as they occur in the field of artificial intelligence but does not have as its goal the construction of ""thinking machines."" Instead, the emphasis is on practical problems that are important in business and industry, even though the solutions of many of these problems makes use of techniques that a thinking machine should be expected to have. Data mining has become an enormous industry, and has even been the subject of political and legal concerns due to the efforts of some governments to mine data on its citizens. This book gives a general overview of data mining with emphasis on classification and associative analysis. Anyone who is interested in data mining could read the book, but some rather sophisticated background in mathematics will be needed to read some of the sections. Pseudocode is given throughout the book to illustrate the different data mining algorithms. There are also exercises at the end of each chapter, but noticeably missing in the book is the inclusion of real case studies in data mining. The inclusion of these case studies would alert the reader to the fact that data mining is of great interest from the standpoint of business and industry, and would lessen the belief that data mining is just another academic field or just another branch of statistics.Speaking somewhat loosely, the goal of data mining is to find interesting patterns in massive amounts of data or the classification of such patterns. This entails of course that one have a notion of what is ""interesting"" and one of  the main problems in data mining is to find suitable `interestingness measures'. And since one is typically dealing with large amounts of data, one must use various statistical sampling and preprocessing techniques to massage the data and obtain a `representative' sample of the original data. In addition, one must be able to handle data that is `anomalous', i.e. data that has characteristics that are markedly different from most of the other data, or that has attributes that are unusual if compared with typical values for those attributes. These issues and techniques are discussed in detail in the first three chapters of the book, where the authors outline some of the bread-and-butter topics needed for effective manipulation of data.The real substance and power of data mining comes from its role in classification and for discovering interesting patterns in huge data sets. The authors, in chapters 4 - 7, discuss various powerful techniques for data classification and association analysis. Association analysis in particular has been used quite extensively in recent years, due to the use of market basket transactions in on-line purchasing and the goal of marketers to learn the purchasing behavior of their customers. Association analysis uncovers relationships in the marketing data in the form of `association rules'. For disjoint itemsets X and Y, an association rule is a logical implication expression between these itemsets that has a certain `strength' that is measured by its `support' and `confidence.' The support measures how often a rule is applicable to a given data set, while the confidence measures how frequently the items in Y appear in X. The support reflects the ability of the rule to be not due to chance alone, while the confidence measures the reliability of the rule inference. The collection of all association rules that can be formed from a data set is too large to be practical and so strategies must be developed to prune the number of rules. The authors discuss in detail various methods for dealing with this computational drawback, such as `frequent itemset generation' and `rule generation.'The detection of anomalies consists of the identification of `outliers', which as the name implies are data objects that lie ""far away"" from the other data objects. It remains of course to quantity what it means to be ""far away"" and for this reason this branch of data mining, as the author points out, is sometimes called `deviation detection' or `exception mining'. The omission of outliers is sometimes justified, since they are merely artifacts that only serve to alter the statistics of a particular data set. However, sometimes their presence signals important information, if not a major scientific discovery. Data mining therefore must contain tools that detect anomalies intelligently and efficiently. The authors discuss anomaly detection in fair detail, emphasizing the statistical techniques that are available to do it. They classify the techniques for anomaly detection as being `unsupervised', `supervised', and `semi-supervised'. As the name implies, supervised anomaly detection requires the existence of a training set with both anomalous and ""normal"" data with each class being labeled as such. When these labels are unavailable, one has to perform unsupervised anomaly detection, and for this approach to work the anomalies must be distinct from one another. If the normal data is labeled but the anomalies are not, one must do semi-supervised anomaly detection. The only weakness in the authors' discussion is that they do not include real-world case studies that illustrate the different techniques, such as clustering and density methods.",Introduction to Data Mining,59.07

The book is light on math and heavy on application, which is great at maintaining interest.  This book is not commonly used as a course textbook at the grad level because of its shallow treatment of the underlying math.Sometimes you just want to know how, and worry about why later.Also, if you think data mining might be of use to your research or your professional work, this book provides a broad overview of topics.

101,0321321367,"I decided to start with this book as I think it is the most convenient to start in the data mining field. One big advantage of the book is the way data mining techniques are explained. It is mainly based on textual and graphical explanations. There is little equations, only what is necessary to implement the algorithms.This book widely cover areas such as data preparation and understanding, classification, anomaly detection, association analysis and clusering. Although the book has a strong emphasis on the two last ones, nearly all standard data mining techniques are at least briefly discussed. However, this book does only have a fiew pages about kernel methods for example. Indeed, it is normal, as kernel methods are more suitable for machine learning (I mean making prediction) than data mining (I mean looking for description).Therefore, this book is:* able to explain data mining without thousands of equations* a good way to start with data mining* covering nearly all standard data mining techniques* focused on association analysis and clusteringand it is not:* a good book for kernel methods and other advanced techniques* written in the statistical nor in the database perspectiveMy comment: if you are in the data mining field and not comming from mathematics or databases, then you really should buy this book.",Introduction to Data Mining,59.07
102,0321321367,"We used this book in a class which was my first academic introduction to data mining.The book's strengths are that it does a good job covering the field as it was around the 2008-2009 timeframe. Included are discussions of exploring data, classification, clustering, association analysis, cluster analysis, and anomaly detection. Additional bonus appendices cover some elements of linear algebra, dimensionality reduction, probability and statistics, regression analysis, and optimization, in case those concepts are fuzzy for the student. They're by no means thorough enough to learn the topic, merely to remind the reader of salient points they should remember.I liked the structure of the book, with each analysis topic being divided into a basic concepts and algorithms chapter, followed by an additional issues and algorithms chapter.I liked that when algorithms were presented, they were presented as pseudocode rather than in any particular language.What I did not like is that separating the concepts from their applications created a bit too much distance for those wanting to apply these concepts. In our class, we were using a tool called Weka, which provides reference implementations of various data mining algorithms in Java, and sometimes it was difficult to tell what we should learn from the results of our experiments. The book did not discuss this very deeply, and certainly not against the types of results that we were getting from our application.During the course, because I knew we would be relying on Weka, I purchased a copy of ISBN-10: 0123748569 http://www.amazon.com/Data-Mining-Practical-Techniques-Management/dp/0123748569/ref=pd_bxgy_b_text_b, which was written by the group that maintains Weka. I found their book to be helpful while I ran the Weka tool, and I was able to use it to develop command line use of the tool and solve some memory management problems. This book also covers much the same ground, although from a bit more practical perspective.Later, because I'm interested in data mining in a large database environment, I purchased ISBN-10: 0123814790 http://www.amazon.com/Data-Mining-Concepts-Techniques-Management/dp/0123814790/ref=pd_bxgy_b_text_c, which is much more focused on the ""how"" of data mining, to include describing the use of data cubes and the necessities of processing it using data mining algorithms.I cannot complain about Tan's book, just that I wished it had slightly more thorough explanations of what one should learn as data mining is certainly an iterative process. If you're interested in Weka, I recommend the Witten book, and if you're new to data modeling as well, I recommend the Han book.",Introduction to Data Mining,59.07
103,0321321367,"As databases keep growing unabatedly, so too has the need for smart data mining. For a competitive edge in business, it helps to be able to analyse your data in unique ways. This text gives you a thorough education in state of the art data mining. Appropriate for both a student and a professional in the field.The extensive problem sets are well suited for the student. These often expand on concepts in the narrative, and are worth tackling.The central theme in the book is how to classify data, or find associations or clusters within it.Cluster analysis gets two chapters that are superbly done. These summarise decades of research into methods of grouping data into clusters. Usually hard to do, because an element of subjectivity can creep into the results. If your data is scattered in some n-dimensional space, then clusters might exist. But how to find them? The chapters show that the number of clusters and the constituents of these can depend on which method you adopt, and various initial conditions, like [essentially] seed values for clusters, if you choose a prototype cluster method like K-means.The descriptions of the cluster algorithms are succinct. Why is this useful? Because it helps you easily understand the operations of the algorithms, without drowning you in low level detail. Plus, by presenting a meta-level comparison between the algorithms, you can develop insight into rolling your own methods, specific to your data.Part of my research involves finding new ways to make clusters, and the text was very useful in explaining the existing ideas.",Introduction to Data Mining,59.07

Yes, the book has lots of nice pictures and easy examples, but that is exactly the problem. There are lots and lots of simple examples to explain the most basic concepts, but when it gets complicated the book often sounds as if the text was taken out of a mathematics book. For example: the basics of probability theory are introduced for over 5 pages with the example of ""two coloured boxes each containing fruit"". Nothing wrong with that. Then the chapter continues with probability densities which are covered within 2 pages and contain sentences like ""Under a nonlinear change of variable, a probability density transforms differently from a simple function, due to the Jacobian factor"". There is no mentioning how a simple function exactly transforms, what a Jacobian factor actually is and why we would be interested in a nonlinear change. Surely, some of the introductory pages could have been thrown out to explain in depth the more difficult issues.

109,0387310738,"Usually considered to be a branch of artificial intelligence, especially at the present time, pattern recognition is defined in this book as the automatic discovery of regularities in data by the use of computer algorithms and the use of these regularities for classifying the data in different categories. The first part of this definition is typically referred to as `unsupervised learning' and the latter `supervised learning.' Both of these areas have resulted in a gargantuan amount of research due to their importance in areas such as medicine, genomics, network modeling, financial engineering, and voice recognition. This book emphasizes a ""conceptual"" approach to teaching pattern recognition, and therefore is highly valuable to those who need to learn the subject. Too often this field is taught purely from the formal standpoint, or conversely by the use of many trivial examples that illustrate the algorithms that are used. These approaches make the subject appear to be either a highly-developed mathematical one (which it is) or a cookbook that does not have a sound foundation. This book is one of the few that will allow the reader to gain a more in-depth understanding and appreciation of the subject as preparation for doing research and development in pattern recognition. The author claims that the book is self-contained as far as background in probability theory is concerned, but readers should still be prepared with this background in order to better appreciate the content. The Bayesian paradigm dominates the book, as it should given the current emphasis in research circles.Some of the highlights of the book include discussions on:* Relative entropy and mutual information. These two concepts have become very important in recent years, especially in the validation of pattern recognition models, the selection of relevant variables, and in independent component analysis.* Periodic variables and how they can be used in contexts where Gaussian distributions are problematic.* Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling, especially the role of the detailed balance condition in obtaining the acceptance probability for the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm.* Bayesian linear regression and its ability to deal with the over-fitting problem in calculations of maximum likelihood and the determination of model complexity.* Kernel learning (usually called support vector machines in other books).Some of the minuses of the book include:* Needs more in-depth discussion of Bayesian neural networks, over and above what is done in the book. The author's does devote a section in the book to this topic, but given its enormous importance, especially in automated learning and economic forecasting, more examples need to be included.* More real-world test cases need to be included, along with a comparison of the efficacies of different approaches, so as to illustrate the ""no free lunch"" philosophy.* More exercises that require more analysis on part of the reader, instead of derivation-type problems or straightforward numerical exercises.* Needs more details on independent component analysis.

114,0387310738,"First of all, as some other reviewers have pointed out, the subtitle of the book should include the word 'Bayesian' in some form or the other. The reason this is important is because the Bayesian approach, although an important one, is not adapted across the board in machine learning, and consequently, an astonishing number of methods presented in the book (Bayesian versions of just about anything) are not mainstream. The recent Duda book gives a better idea of the mainstream in this sense, but because the field has evolved in such rapidity, it excludes massive recent developments in kernel methods and graphical models, which Bishop includes.Pedagogically, however, this book is almost uniformly excellent. I didn't like the presentation on some of the material (the first few sections on linear classification are relatively poor), but in general, Bishop does an amazing job. If you want to learn the mathematical base of most machine learning methods in a practical and reasonably rigorous way, this book is for you. Pay attention in particular to the exercises, which are the best I've seen so far in such a text; involved, but not frustrating, and always aiming to further elucidate the concepts. If you want to really learn the material presented, you should, at the very least, solve all the exercises that appear in the sections of the text (about half of the total). I've gone through almost the entire text, and done just that, so I can say that it's not as daunting as it looks. To judge your level regarding this, solve the exercises for the first two chapters (the second, a sort of crash course on probability, is quite formidable). If you can do these, you should be fine. The author has solutions for a lot of them on his website, so you can go there and check if you get stuck on some.As far as the Bayesian methods are concerned, they are usually a lot more mathematically involved than their counterparts, so solving the equations representing them can only give you more practice. Seeing the same material in a different light can never hurt you, and I learned some important statistical/mathematical concepts from the book that I'd never heard of, such as the Laplace and Evidence Approximations. Of course, if you're not interested, you can simply skip the method altogether.From the preceding, it should be clear that the book is written for a certain kind of reader in mind. It is not for people who want a quick introduction to some method without the gory details behind its mathematical machinery. There is no pseudocode. The book assumes that once you get the math, the algorithm to implement the method should either become completely clear, or in the case of some more complicated methods (SVMs for example), you know where to head for details on an implementation. Therefore, the people who will benefit most from the book are those who will either be doing research in this area, or will be implementing the methods in detail on lower level languages (such as C). I know that sounds offputting, but the good thing is that the level of the math required to understand the methods is quite low; basic probability, linear algebra and multivariable calculus. (Read the appendices in detail as well.) No knowledge is needed, for example, of measure-theoretic probability or function spaces (for kernel methods) etc. Therefore the book is accessible to most with a decent engineering background, who are willing to work through it. If you're one of the people who the book is aimed at, you should seriously consider getting it.Edited to Add:I've changed my rating from 4 stars to 5.

116,0387310738,"This book is a fairly thorough overview of typical topics employed in a graduate machine learning course. However, from page 5 on, expect to see more equations on each page than paragraphs of text (with most of the remaining text explaining the context of the variables within the equations). Now, for someone such as myself who enjoys mathematics, this is not a problem. However, I would not recommend this book for someone with a mathematics background that is in any way weak. Furthermore, there is a more fundamental problem with the presentation of the material that warrants this book no more than a 3-star rating: the simple intuitiveness of the concepts is completely lost within the mathematics. Instead of explaining what variables represent and leaving it to the reader to figure  out what is going on, this book could be made much more approachable by simply stating the intuition behind the equations. Take the sum rule, one of the first theorems in the book, for an example of how the author muddles what is effectively a basic and intuitive concept: the book has a fairly lengthy definition of several variables representing concepts such as ""the number of observations in which x_ij appears"" prior to presenting a summation over all y-variables (a notational convention that the author admits is ""cumbersome"" on the next page, and states that ""there will be no need for such pedantry"" as that which he proceeds to perpetrate throughout the book!), while he could have simply presented the simplified sum on the following page (p(X) = sum(p(X,Y), Y)) and it would be immediately clear to most readers what he was attempting to explain. He could also simply state the intuition behind the theorem in English, that summing over every event yields a probability of one, and therefore summing over all events in which a variable appears effectively marginalizes the variable (something he comes close to doing after the presentation of the equation, but by then, the reader's time has already been wasted). Similar examples abound throughout the book, becoming particularly bad during the middle sections, when the techniques begin to become less intuitive.As another reader mentioned, the author also commits the serious mistake of using pi for a symbol other than the constant or the product operator, which muddles the equations on a skim and forces the reader to refer back to the variable definitions to determine the context.Having done work in machine learning's applied cousin, data mining, and thus having used many of the techniques presented in the book in actual research, I can't help but think that the presentation of the book's content could be much clearer. When doing work in the field, we can look up the equations as-needed; it is the knowledge of *when* and *how* to apply or extend these techniques that is more important, and that is the area in which I feel this book is lacking.",Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning (Information Science and Statistics),25.6

I would definitely recommend it for those who want to learn statistical/machine learning on their own. The only thing that I don't like is that it often tries to present theories under a probabilistic framework. My personal opinion is that Probabilities is a nice way to present easy theories in a super complex way. I tend to think in a more linear algebra/optimization framework. After so many years in Academia probabilities still confuse me.  Hopefully the author doesn't use only the probabilistic framework, that is why I like it",Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning (Information Science and Statistics),25.6

He is, however, fairly generous with equations, and his derivations are well-presented and easy to follow.Initially I thought the book was way too dense, and skipped way too many steps, providing what amounted to a rough sketch of the material. That said, after I read the chapters a few times, and consulted other materials, I came to find that every chapter I read in-depth is actually quite thorough.Cons: Doesn't repeat anything, which is an interesting pedagogical tactic. No examples, so you're on your own in terms of actually implementing these things.Pros: Provides a relatively large amount of depth on a large number of topics. Equations are derived enough so you really know what's going on.Bottom line: Buy it. It's dense, and there are no examples, but it's a great staple book because it provides a robust outline of the theory behind many methods. Sure, sometimes you won't know what he's talking about, but you can look up the stuff he leaves out without much fuss. The stuff he does include, though, is very hard to find elsewhere.",Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning (Information Science and Statistics),25.6
119,0387310738,This book is quite good in explaining basics of pattern recognition and machine learning and enables the reader to relate the theory to diverse practical applications. The explanations are very simple. It is better to have thorough knowledge of random vectors and linear algebra to derive maximum benefit from this book. I would recommend this book to any one new to this field.,Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning (Information Science and Statistics),25.6
120,0387310738,"It's hard to figure out who would actually benefit from this book - it amounts to seven hundred pages of equations interrupted by blocks of text that fail to provide any intuition whatever for the techniques they are describing, and the occasional graph which is remarkable in the universe of graphs as being scarcely more informative than the equations it is meant to illustrate.Seriously, you have to wonder wtf Bishop thought he was doing here.  As a catalog of equations for people who already thoroughly understand the learning algorithms I suppose the book can be considered adequate.  For any didactic purpose you're wasting your time - you can find dense, technically correct but incomprehensible descriptions for any of these methods online, for free.  A textbook ought to aspire to more - should bring some order to the chaos, re-tell a technical story in a new light to make it more sensible and intuitive.  This book is so bad in these regards that it makes me angry.On a related note, I can't believe that Duda and Hart is still the best machine learning / pattern rec. book on the market after thirty years or whatever.

121,0387310738,"This new book by Chris Bishop covers most areas of pattern recognition quite exhaustively. The author is an expert, this is evidenced by the excellent insights he gives into the complex math behind the machine learning algorithms. I have worked for quite some time with neural networks and have had coursework in linear algebra, probability and regression analysis, and found some of the stuff in the book quite illuminating.But that said, I must point out that the book is very math heavy. Inspite of my considerable background in the area of neural networks and statistics, I still was struggling with the equations. This is certainly not the book that can teach one things from the ground up, and thats why I would give it only 3 stars. I am new to kernels, and I am finding the relevant chapters difficult and confusing. This book wont be very useful if all you want to do is write machine learning code. The intended audience for this book I guess are PhD students/researchers who are working with the math related aspects of machine learning. Undergraduates or people with little exposure to machine learning will have a hard time with this book. But that said, time spent in struggling with the contents of this book will certainly pay-off, not instantly though.",Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning (Information Science and Statistics),25.6
122,0387310738,"I think this is a great text considering the vast array of topics covered by Bishop in this book. The best thing I liked about the book are the fantastic insights the author has provided on various methods and their usage limitations, sometimes in very easy to understand language and studded with some real practical experience going behind it. One thing which I found rather missing was the excessive use of equations without much dwell into their derivations, which can sometimes confuse the first time reader, but when worked diligently by hand, would make the stuff clearer. Said that, the book is a great text for someone to gain latest perspectives on the field from the author's rich research experience. I would definitely recommend someone who wants a fairly broad and usable knowledge about this field.",Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning (Information Science and Statistics),25.6
123,0387310738,"Bishop's book about machine learing and pattern recognition is well written and the figures are really pretty because they are in color and informative. Overall the book looks very nice and it is fun to read in. In my opinion only the book 'The Elements of Statistical Learning' by Hastie et al. looks comparably well.The book is a textbook rather than a monograph and, hence, intended for students rather than researchers and the coverage of machine learning topics is thorough without being able to cover every topic in deepth. This is not really a draw back because no book is able to do this anyway. The presentation of the methods is informative and, depending on the background of the reader, clear enough to figure out how it works to use the method.What is the problem: I do not like that the methods are introduced not rigourously but by examples. That mean Bishop does not have the definiton, theorem, proof style but is more heuristic. This may sound very helpful for the reader not familiar with the topic to reduce the barrier of understanding by providing examples to visulalize the problem. The problem is, in my opinion, that this is not the case but the oposite. In think it is never wrong to provide examples and it is absolutely desirable but after the examples are given and one has an intuitive understanding of the problem one wants to see its formal solution because that's what machine learning is about, it is applied statistics. For this reason I give only 4 instead of 5 points (but not less because also all the other books about this topic fail in this respect).Overall, the book is well done and certainly a good source of information for students and researches.",Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning (Information Science and Statistics),25.6
124,0387310738,"I started to read this book after I gave up the book ""element of statisitcal learning"" which I read about 80 pages.  I won't say that the latter book EoSL is bad, but it definitely assumes a much higher math background.  Also it doesn't give all the derivations and reasonings, so it may take a long time to understand a single paragraph. The reading is slow and frustrating.  I read each chapter twice, but still do not think I did get it in my heart.By contrast, the book ""Pattern Recognition and machine learning"" assumes much less math background, and usually gives complete derivation and reasoning, which makes it a pleasure to read.  Therefore, if you are not in statistics major (but a CS major with reasonable statistics background), I recommend you to start this book.Answers to some problems are posted in the author's website (just google the author's name).  It is a big plus to me.",Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning (Information Science and Statistics),25.6
125,0387848576,"The book is excellent if you want to use it as a reference and study machine learning by yourself. It's quite comprehensive and deep in areas in which authors are most familiar & famous (frequentist approach, ensemble techniques,  maximum likelihood and its variations, lasso). I would recommend you Bishop's machine learning book as an alternative if you want to gain a deeper understanding of Bayesian techniques--that one is more readable as well.  Hastie et al's book is just ok from a didactic point of view. The real world examples are complicated to follow (would prefer simpler synthetic data sets). Some descriptions & explanations are too terse--a price to pay for comprehensiveness in a small volume. Overall, a great effort and useful contribution. You'll most likely need to check out other sources to gain a deeper understanding of some of the topics discussed.

The discussion of cross validation is great, and the way it is related to other aspects of the model selection problem is masterly.

129,0387848576,"This should certainly not be the first statistics book you read, or even the second or third book, but when you are ready for it then you should absolutely read it.  But be prepared to read it very slowly and digest each page.  Its greatest strength is that it shows how much of modern statistics comes down to a few fundamental issues: bias, variance, model complexity, and the curse of dimensionality.  There is no free lunch in statistics, methods that claim to avoid these tradeoffs only do so by adding more assumptions about the structure of your data.  If your data match the assumptions of such methods, you gain statistical power, but if your data don't match the assumptions then you lose.By looking closely at the assumptions, the book shows how many contemporary methods that look different are fundamentally similar under the hood.And in my own work I have adopted their use of open circles for the points in scatterplots.  These circles are easier to see than tiny solid dots, but overlapping symbols don't cover each other the way large filled symbols do.","The Elements of Statistical Learning: Data Mining, Inference, and Prediction, Second Edition (Springer Series in Statistics)",45.45

Do not expect to sit down and just read it like a novel for a quick overview of statistical learning methods. Warning, expect some heavy duty math. In the interest of full disclosure I'll repeat: expect mega-math. The authors claim you can read the book and avoid what they term ""technically challenging"" sections, but I'm not really sure how one would do that. The book presents just about every important ML technique from decision trees to neural nets and boosting to ensemble methods.

131,0387848576,"This is a quite interesting, and extremely useful book, but it is wearing to read in large chunks.  The problem, if you want to call it that, is that it is essentially a 700 page catalogue of clever hacks in statistical learning.  From a technical point of view it is well-ehough structured, but there is not the slightest trace of an overarching philosophy.  And if you don't actually have a philosophical perspective in place before you start, the read you face might well be an even harder grind.  Be warned.Some of the reviews here complain that there is too much math.  I don't think that is an issue.  If you have decent intuitions in geometry, linear algebra, probability and information theory, then you should be able to cruise through and/or browse in a fairly relaxed way. If you don't have those intuitions, then you are attempting to read the wrong book.There were a couple of things that I expected (things I happen to know a bit about), but that were missing.  On the unsupervised learning side, the discussion of Gaussian mixture clustering was, I thought, a bit short and superficial, and did not bring out the combination of theoretical and practical power that the method offers.  On the supervised learning side, I was surprised that a book that dedicates so much time to linear regression finds no room for a discussion of Gaussian process regression as far as I could see (the nearest point of approach is the use of Gaussian radial basis functions [oops: having written that, I immediately came across a brief discussion (S5.8.1) of, essentially, GP regression - though with no reference to standard literature]).","The Elements of Statistical Learning: Data Mining, Inference, and Prediction, Second Edition (Springer Series in Statistics)",45.45

I think a lot of stuff might be better illustrated with mathematical formulae rather than words or both.  For e.g., I was trying to understand what is surrogate variable, getting a big picture from the English is okay, but to actually compute it, I find information not as clear.

135,0387952845,"Data mining is a field developed by computer scientists but many of its crucial elements are imbedded in important and subtle statistical concepts. Statisticians can play an important role in the development of this field but as was the case with artificial intelligence, expert systems and neural networks the statistical research community has been slow to respond. Hastie, Tibshirani and Friedman are changing this.Friedman has been a major player in pattern recognition of high dimensional data, in tree classification, regularized discriminant analysis and multivariate adaptive regression splines. He has also done some exciting new research on boosting methods.Hastie and Tibshirani invented additive models which are very general types of regression models. Tibshirani invented the lasso method and is a leader among the researchers on bootstrap. Hastie invented principal curves and surfaces.These tools and the expertise of these authors make them naturals to contribute to advances in data mining. They come with great expertise and see data mining from the statistical perspective. They see it as part of a more general process of statistical learning from data.The book is well written and illustrated with many pretty color graphs and figures. Color adds a dimension in pattern recognition and the authors exploit it in this book. It is really the first of its kind that treats data mining from a statistical perspective and is so comprehensive and up-to-date.The important statistical tools that are covered in this book include under the category of supervised learning; regression, discriminant analysis, kernel methods, model assessment and selection, bootstrapping, maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference, additive models, classification and regression trees, multivariate adaptive regression splines, boosting, regularization methods, nearest neighbor classification, k means clustering algorithms and neural networks. These methods are illustrated using real problems.Similarly under the category of unsupervised learning, clustering and association are covered. They cover the latest developments in principal components and principal curves, multidimensional scaling, factor analysis and projection pursuit.This book is innovative and fresh. It is an important contribution that will become a classic. The level is between intermediate and advanced. Good for an advanced special topics course for graduate students in statistics. A comparable text is the text by Mannila, Hand and Smyth.This book made effective use of color and maintained a competitive price.  This had a major impact on publishers like Wiley that could not sell a book at this size and initial price.  Wiley is still looking for a book comparable to this one that they can use to compete with Springer-Verlag.

136,0387952845,"The book is written by some of the biggest names currently in the field, and thus is written at a certain level, this isn't a fault of the book or the authers, but rather it was written for a specific audience.  However I did find it odd when they would occassionally explain basic readily known notation, but later on assume the reader is familiar with what I would regard as advanced notation, or leave out quite a few steps in their mathematics assuming the reader understands what they did.  This book covers a wide range of techniques ranging from the more traditional to the current, and for each topic presents an overview of the technique and provides adequate references for further exploration.The reader should have a good underlying understanding of linear algebra, statistics and probability theory and also be familiar with the techniques presented here.  This book was used in a graduate engineering data mining class, and most of us struggled greatly with the book.  This book probably would have been more appropriate if this was a book to augment another text, or if this had not been the first time we had seen topics such as those presented, this being the book to explain neural networks, support vector machines and whatnot when you've never seen them before makes for a very bewildering experience, but once you find a few journal articles the techniques actually are fairly easy to understand.The book does not explain how to implement using software any of the techniques, this is a topic left up to other books, such as Modern Applied Statistics with S by Ripley and Venerables, and only in their discussion about apriori for association rules did I see that they state a software package.  It would have been nice if they would have given some insight into how they created some of the great graphics that punctuate the book, perhaps as additional material on the website.A book that is more down to earth for engineers, albeit different in scope, would be Duda and Hart's Pattern Classification, which I believe are electrical engineers and written more from an engineering standpoint.  In addition the Duda and Hard book gives a lot of applications-based problems and has an associated MATLAB handbook to walk readers through building many types of learners, while this book the end-of-chapter excercises are almost exclusively proofs and theoretical excercises.  Not a fault of the book, but rather just a difference and depends on what the reader wants to get out of it.Ultimately, even though it did prove to be a rather confusing book, I have learned a lot from it and will continue to go through it to learn even more from it as it does tend to become more lucid the more I go through it.","The Elements of Statistical Learning: Data Mining, Inference, and Prediction (Springer Series in Statistics)",18.6

This book assumes that you already have some background and quite a bit of familiarity with the subject2. While it contains many topics, most materials are only ""presented"" rather than ""clearly explained"". And so, while it may be good as a reference book, at least for me, this definitely shouldn't be your main resource when first studying the subject.3. Definitely the authors are expert on the field and I just hope they would come up with a much better revision of the book4. One nice feature of the book ... it contains pretty picture! Unfortunately, just like the old saying, ""a picture contains a thousand words"". Thats exactly what happens here. Some of the pictures are hard to understand.It may or may not be fair to give this book 1 star (I might update my rating in the future).

The opposite is almost true. One reviewer wrote, it is no book for beginners. Well, that is not my point. My point is, e.g., a chapter or section starts and the introduction provided to this topic under consideration is almost completely missing. Moreover, the explanations given in the main text are just not good. Sorry, it makes not much sense to collect and present a lot of deep results of scientific articles in statistical learning theory without the necessary explanations. One should not forget, each section corresponds roughly to one or even more articles. One would expect from the authors to provide a precise summary of the main points in an appealing way. Negative report!

However, I believe it would have been helpful to add supplemental material that contains completed examples using XLMiner for each model. The documentation on XLMiner seemed to skim over often critical steps. I would question my confidence level of my results.

142,0470526823,"I am a data mining trainer and consultant. This book not only has good content, but it offers a 90 day license of software with which to rehearse the case study examples. My comments on the book will be accompanied by comments on the software. The book is the perfect fit for its intended audience. With the caution that certain readers will do better elsewhere, I think it is a great book. The major topics are addressed, albeit briefly, with clarity. If you are a first timer reader of this subject, there are not many books that will do a better job explaining these technical subjects for a general audience.Like most full time data miners, I would have difficulty living within the constraints of Excel. XLMiner is a fine piece of software, but it lives inside Excel as an Excel add-on. The most famous limitation is having no more than 1,000,000 rows of data, but that nature of that limitation applied to Data Mining is frequently misunderstood. I am often on projects with ""big data"" clients where I only model 100,000 or fewer records. XLMiner allows you to read from a database larger than Excel can handle, and let's you write out to a database larger than Excel can handle. I was surprised and impressed by this. In the end, though, it still isn't enough. I need to be able to merge and manipulate my large data files so that I can carefully select the smaller fraction that I am going to model. In short, I can't live without my more powerful tools. There is an essay offered as a sidebar in the book on the state of the Data Mining Software Tools market by Herb Edelstein which discusses exactly this fact. XLMiner was originally developed as a piece of teaching software, and it excels at that. It doesn't intend to be a deployment tool for the whole business enterprise like some of the more powerful Data Mining suites. If you don't have access to such tools you might be pleasantly surprised what it can do since the other tools are many times more expensive.Despite this limitation, this is a strong book. It would be just perfect for MBAs that are intrigued with Data Mining. It would be great for a first course in Data Mining provided that it wasn't the first of many. If someone were about to embark on a Data Mining advanced degree, I don't think this book is the best route to go. I would suggest Handbook of Statistical Analysis and Data Mining Applications as an introduction for that audience. I also think it is an outstanding choice for a seminar leader that wants to offer demonstrations for the audience. I would suggest providing the audience with copies (or allowing them to get them). What a great way to learn the material - by doing. I debated using this book for exactly that purpose and ended up going with the Handbook of Statistical Analysis and Data Mining Applications only because I felt my audience, representing larger companies, would end up using one the Data Mining suites in the end, and I wanted them to see them.I would also suggest this book for self study. It is as easy a read as this kind of material is going to get. Technical? Yes. Light reading? Not really. However, Data Mining algorithms never make for light reading. What you hope for is clarity, and the right amount of detail. For the uninitiated, this is perfect. For Data Mining professionals, it would be just a very basic review. Some reviewers seems to have found it a tough slog. It is very much in the style of ""here is the rough idea - try a case study"". If you've never studied statistics, there is no careful walk through of the formulas, but that is not the point of the book. Lots of other books do that. If you want to know how Data Mining works ""under the hood"" you won't really find that here either. For example, Regression is covered in about 15 pages. Overall, I think it makes good choices in terms of detail.It covers all the material you need in an introduction. It offers a very brief initial chapter defining the subject. It does a decent job at data visualization. It is a basic introduction the algorithms with supporting case studies. The is almost no data preparation because XLMiner is not designed to do any heavy lifting here. It can do partitioning and explains why this is critical to data mining. For a good discussion of data preparation and Excel read Linoff's fine book Data Analysis Using SQL and Excel. A surprising number of the famous techniques are here: neural nets, k nearest neighbors, clustering, classification trees and even time series analysis. The case studies are fairly basic, but well described. They are easy to download from the website. Again, perfect for a first course in Data Mining.

146,0615684378,"RapidMiner is an open-source, freely-available data mining software suite that uses a graphical-process-workflow approach similar to SAS Enterprise Miner or SPSS Modeler (formerly the Clementine product suite).  RapidMiner is very powerful with many built-in operators and it also contains an R-extension module so any R code or functions can be incorporated into its environment, giving it enormous flexibility.  And since it is a guided graphical user work environment, the learning curve for new users is much more friendly than that of a true text programming interface such as R itself.However, RapidMiner suffers from a general lack of awareness here in the USA and relatively scarce documentation for learning the program.  This book is definitely not a RapidMiner user manual, but it does provide a guided series of exercises to perform different types of data mining exercises in RapidMiner.  It would be very helpful for training new analysts on the basics in RapidMiner, and the fact that it provides actual datasets (downloaded from a companion website) so that the analyst can ""work along"" with the text is essential.  The book covers topics such as basic data preparation, clustering, discriminant analysis, linear and logistic regression, decision trees, neural nets, and text mining.  Overall, it would be a terrific guide if you were interested in learning how to use a free and open source tool for these types of advanced data analysis (far beyond what you can accomplish in Excel or Access alone).

No significant prior knowledge is assumed, except for being able to use spreadsheets and I suppose having some very basic statistical knowledge.I already had some experience with RapidMiner and know my way around databases and data manipulation. The book was still useful but I read across it fairly quickly. I would have preferred to see more info on the statistical algorithms explained in the book as well as some other more 'advanced' techniques such as SVMs. But I guess this was not the purpose of the book.If you want more details on the actual statistics behind the techniques then I would recommend Vercellis - Business Intelligence, Data Mining and Optimization for Decision Making.",Data Mining for the Masses,23.36

It simply instructs the reader on how to use the RapidMiner data mining software to perform very simple data analyses.  (By the way RapidMiner is fabulous, and free, so try it out if you have not already!)  But be warned, if you have any experience at all with RapidMiner, then it will probably be too simplistic for you.

With the combined power of Internet tools and cheap hard drives, search engines and archival databases can enable almost anyone to find information about almost anyone else.Today's challenge, however, is not finding or storing the data, but rather making sense of it. That's where Investigative Data Mining for Security and Criminal Detection comes in. It shows how myriad distributed data streams can be harnessed to fight crime.Through easy-to-read prose, the reader learns how to use both public and private databases and networks to find threats and minimize risks. Besides explaining how data mining is done, the book introduces the reader to such techniques as intelligent agents (software that performs user-delegated tasks autonomously), link analysis (a process involving the mapping of the associations between suspects and locations), and text mining (a process used to identify a document's content based on linguistic analysis) and how they can aid law enforcement.For example, law enforcement in the United Kingdom use text mining to ""institutionalize the knowledge of criminal perpetrators and organized gangs and groups,"" author Jes&uacute;s Mena writes.

As such, it is itself a powerful tool for the industry.",Investigative Data Mining for Security and Criminal Detection,27.85
160,0750676132,"I was very excited when I bought the book, but was somewhat disappointed. The reason for that is the book is very light on details and tends to talk about things rather then on how things are done and how they work. The book does cover some tools but with no connection to concepts and with few details on how the tools do what they do. It does contain a lot of interesting material and s generally well written.Of the most interest to me was the intrusion detection chapter, but in addition to a well-known facts on IDS technology it provided few details on how exactly data mining helps.

163,0750676132,"I read ""Investigative Data Mining for Security and Criminal Detection"" (IDM) after attending the 2003 Recent Advances in Intrusion Detection (RAID) conference.  Researchers at RAID mentioned ""self-organizing maps,"" ""neural networks,"" ""machine learning,"" and other unfamiliar topics.  Mena's book helped me understand these subjects in the context of performing data mining.  If you steer clear of the author's discussion of intrusion detection in chapter 10, you'll find IDM enlightening and a little scary.Author Jesus Mena defines investigative data mining as ""the visualization, organization, sorting, clustering, segmenting, and predicting of criminal behavior"" (p.1).  His book strays from this definition, as he also covers simply discovering patterns of activity for responding to events.  Accomplishing this task requires investigative data warehousing, link analysis, software agents, text mining, neural networks, and machine learning.  Mena addresses each technique in its own chapter, offering descriptions, case studies, and tools.  Two types of data mining analysis exist: descriptive, such as a chart, graph, or decision tree; and predictive, obtained via neural networks and machine learning (p.261).  Mena also describes mining via ""top-down"" vs ""bottom-up"" approaches.  The first involves an analyst exploring data to support his theories.  The second relies on software to find patterns in data not imagined by a human analyst (p.343).Mena is most effective when he writes about what he knows best.  I loved chapter 9, where he explains cell phone, insurance, and financial frauds.  Much of what he wrote applied directly to my interest in network security monitoring and intrusion detection.  Chapter 10 (Intrusion Detection), however, is best ignored.  Mena does not appear to understand computer security, and neither do his editors.  He calls Snort a ""freeware site-based system IDS,"" in contrast with ""network-based IDSs such as RealSecure"" (p.306).  He labels tcpdump an ""attack"" tool and says ""this is utility for eavesdropping for passwords"" (his typos) (p.307) and describes ""rhosts"" in a ""stealth"" attack phase as ""this utility will evaluate hosts and lists hosts and users who are trusted by the local host"" (p.308).  Mena isn't a ""security guy,"" either; he lumps ""threats and vulnerabilities"" together as ""weaknesses or flaws in a system, such as a hole in security or a back door"" (p.14).  A threat is one or more entities with capabilities and intentions sufficient to exploit vulnerabilities in information resources, while a vulnerability is a weakness in design, configuration, or deployment which allow threats to abuse, subvert, or break information resources.Overall, I really enjoyed IDM.  Mena makes numerous fascinating insights.  While his prose is somewhat repetitive, he explains the key points needed to get data mining newbies up to speed.  In light of the recent revelations of jetBlue sharing data with the government, the techniques Mena describes are both powerful and disturbing.",Investigative Data Mining for Security and Criminal Detection,27.85
164,0750676132,"When I read Mena's book on data mining, it was one of the few references available on the subject. It was an excellent introduction to the subject for me, when I needed to understand the basic concepts and applications of data mining. The language is clear and concise. I drew heavily on it to provide the technical undergirding for my master's (public affairs) thesis on DARPA's Total Information Awareness project. (My rating is largely based on the book's usefulness when I read and used it as a reference in 2004. I cannot judge the book's current utility in the wake of more recent developments in data mining.)",Investigative Data Mining for Security and Criminal Detection,27.85
165,1107422221,"Over a decade ago, Peter Flach of Bristol University wrote a paper on the topic of &#34;On the state of the art in machine learning: A personal review&#34; in which he reviewed several, then recent books, related to developments in machine learning. This included Pat Langley&#8217;s Elements of Machine Learning (Morgan Kaufmann), Tom Mitchell&#8217;s Machine Learning (McGraw-Hill), and Data Mining: Practical Machine Learning Tools and Techniques with Java Implementations by Ian Witten and Eibe Frank (Morgan Kaufman) among many others. Dr. Flach mentioned Michael Berry and Gordon Linoff&#8217;s Data Mining Techniques for Marketing, Sales, and Customer Support (John Wiley) for it's excellent writing style citing the paragraph below and commending &#34;I wish that all computer science textbooks were written like this.&#34;&#8220;People often find it hard to understand why the training set and test set are &#8220;tainted&#8221; once they have been used to build a model. An analogy may help: Imagine yourself back in the 5th grade. The class is taking a spelling test. Suppose that, at the end of the test period, the teacher asks you to estimate your own grade on the quiz by marking the words you got wrong. You will give yourself a very good grade, but your spelling will not improve. If, at the beginning of the period, you thought there should be an &#8216;e&#8217; at the end of &#8220;tomato&#8221;, nothing will have happened to change your mind when you grade your paper. No new data has entered the system. You need a test set! Now, imagine that at the end of the test the teacher allows you to look at the papersof several neighbors before grading your own. If they all agree that &#8220;tomato&#8221; has no final &#8216;e&#8217;, you may decide to mark your own answer wrong. If the teacher gives the same quiz tomorrow, you will do better. But how much better? If you use the papers of the very same neighbors to evaluate your performance tomorrow, you may still be fooling yourself. If they all agree that &#8220;potatoes&#8221; has no more need of an &#8216;e&#8217; then &#8220;tomato&#8221;, and you have changed your own guess to agree with theirs, then you will overestimate your actual grade on the second quiz as well. That is why the evaluation set should be different from the test set.&#8221; [3, pp. 76&#8211;77] Machine-Learning-9781107096394That is why when I recently came across  &#34;Machine Learning The Art and Science of Algorithms that Make Sense of Data&#34;, I decided to check it out and wasn't disappointed. Dr. Flach is the Professor of Artificial Intelligence at the University of Bristol and in this &#34;future classic&#34;, he left no stone unturned when it comes to clarity and explainability.  The book starts with a machine learning sampler, introduces the ingredients of machine learning fast progressing to Binary classification and Beyond. Written as a textbook, riddled with examples, foot-notes and figures, this text elaborates concept learning, tree models, rule models, linear models, distance-based models, probabilistic models to features and ensembles concluding with Machine learning experiments. I really enjoyed the &#34;Important points to remember&#34; section of the book as a quick refresher on machine-learning-commandments.The concept learning section seems to have been influenced by author's own research interest and is not discussed in as much details in contemporary machine learning texts. I also found frequent summarization of concepts to be quite helpful. Contrary to it's subtitle and compared to it's counterparts, the book however is light on algorithms and code, possibly on purpose. While it explains the concepts with examples, number of formal algorithms are kept to a minimum. This may aid in clarity and help avoiding recipe-book-syndrome while making it potentially inaccessible to practitioners. Great at basics, the text also falls short on elaboration of intermediate to advance topics such as LDA, kernel methods, PCA, RKHS, and convex optimization. For instance, in chapter 10 &#34;Matrix transformations and decompositions&#34; could have been made an appendix while expanding upon meaningful topics like LSA and use cases of sparse matrix (pg 327). It is definitely not the book's fault; but rather of this reader expecting too much from an introductory text just because author explains everything so well!As a text book on Machine learning as the Art and Science of Algorithms, Peter Flach definitely delivers on the promise of clarity, with well chosen illustrations and example based approach. A highly recommended reading for all who would like to understand the principles behind machine learning techniques.Materials can be downloaded from here which generously include excerpts with background material and literature references, full set of 540 lecture slides in PDF including all figures in the book with LaTeX beamer source of the above.",Machine Learning: The Art and Science of Algorithms that Make Sense of Data,120.65
166,1107422221,"This book defines machine learning as programs that learn from experience, but it focuses mostly on data mining.  There is a two-page nod to all the other kinds of machine learning, such as all the reinforcement learning work.  I'd prefer data mining to be called data mining.

Author Peter Flach surveys the various types of models: Tree models (e.g., decision trees), rule models, linear models (e.g., regression and SVM), distance-based models (e.g., k Means), and probabilistic models.  He covers all the Usual Suspects, with no surprises.  He ends with a discussion of features and a little coverage of ensemble methods.  There aren't a ton of references, but the bibliography is reasonably long.The methods are presented with the math in matrix algebra form, which I like, and with a high-level algorithm in pseudocode.

168,1107422221,"In my Advanced Statistics class one of the text books wasThe Elements of Statistical Learning: Data Mining, Inference, and Prediction, Second Edition. I found some of the chapters in this book heavy going and I had to read them several times and ask the professor lots of questions before I understood the material.In contrast, Machine Learning by Peter Flach is a very well written, very gentle introduction to machine learning algorithms. Prof. Flach writes that he spent four years writing this book and it shows in the care with which the material is presented.The mathematics used is algebra, exponents, summations, products and a bit of linear algebra.  There are only a few places where derivatives are used (as it turns out, basic linear algebra can be used to describe many machine learning algorithms). The level of the Machine Learning makes it appropriate for an undergraduate Machine Learning course.Machine Learning covers most of the core algorithms in machine learning. Of necessity what is provided is an overview of topics like linear regression and linear classifiers like Support Vector Machines. These are topics that are covered in depth in book likeApplied Regression AnalysisandAn Introduction to Support Vector Machines and Other Kernel-based Learning Methods.Reading this book without taking a class in machine learning can be difficult because there are no exercises with solutions or projects with data. Machine learning is a practical art. It is very difficult to read a ~360 page book and absorb all of the material without the reinforcement of applying the machine learning techniques. As I read the book I constantly wished that the author had included exercises with the associated data on his web site for the major approaches.

It does an excellent job explaining the ""what, why and how"" of complex statistical/machine learning concepts.  The author does and *exceptionally* good job using graphics to build intuitions about what algorithms are used for and how they work.  The reader without a very strong background in mathematics (pure logic and/or set theory)  will find excellent introductions scattered throughout the book.

170,1107422221,"As a previous reviewer has observed, this book addresses the ""data mining"" forms of machine learning, but ignores the agent form of machine learning (such as a robot that learns). The ideas in the former are relevant to the latter, of course; it just seems odd to have them ignored in a book called Machine Learning. Regardless...This is a well done book covering a wide range of topics and covering them well. I don't think one would want to use it (as the sole textbook) in a first class for machine learning because it lacks practical information and examples about how to get down to it. However, it would be good for a graduate-level course of people who already had some hands-on experience but could then benefit from stepping back a bit to understand the field. It would also be good for people who have some mathematical sophistication and work with machine learning researchers, and want to understand better what the field entails.I do like the discussions of things like data transformations and especially the discussion of how to conduct experiments.

171,1107422221,"I'm probably to be considered a ""very advanced amateur"" or ""informal professional"" in machine learning techniques. I never studied them in school, but I presently make a living in part by coding up new ones and coming up with ML solutions for commercial problems. Confronting the field for the first time, I wondered how people learned the stuff. Most of the introductory texts just covered neural nets ... and very very badly. Neural nets are still useful, and probably the most mature of machine learning techniques, but throwing them at a beginner without context is a recipe for confusion and dismay.This text, by contrast, barely mentions them, and puts them in their proper context for the beginner. The right way to think about machine learning is starting with *very* basic statistical techniques and probability theory, and building up from there into simple classification and scoring systems, and then on to the rest of the field. The author of this text does it the right way.One of the difficulties of didactic texts in the subject is ... machine learning is a very diverse field. All kinds of gizmos are helpful, and there isn't an obvious taxonomy, as there is in, say, linear time series models. The author takes a very high level view; breaking the field down into geometric, probabilistic and ""logical"" models. I believe this to be original, and a very powerful way of looking at things for the beginner.The progression is well thought out, and each chapter comes with a useful summary and references (one of which has already proved helpful to me) for further reading. The summaries are not mere recitations; they contain useful facts about the strengths and weaknesses of different varieties of models covered, as well as deep insights that are buried beneath useless verbiage and equations in other texts. There are things covered here which are covered in precious few advanced texts: for example, inductive concept learning seemed to fall off the map after the ""AI winter,"" at least as far as most texts were concerned. The book also manages to take the reader to fairly complex topics: boosting, bagging, lasso, meta-learning and random forests. The last chapter has useful guidance on out of scope topics (reinforcement learning, sequence prediction, etc).The text is well written and has attractive and helpful graphs and figures. Better yet, the layout, color scheme and typesetting is the best I have ever seen in a book of this kind. This seems like a small thing, but far too many color texts end up looking like old school wired magazines: they hurt the eyes with useless graphics and insane colors. Just because you have a broad palette doesn't mean you should use all those colors. The typesetter gets this one just right. I commend the author on his eye for beauty here.Downsides: as a unifying didactic text for beginners (or review for non-beginners), it is near perfect, but it does lack problem sets. For me, this is a feature, rather than a bug, but people teaching from this book might find it tedious to come up with problems which go with the text. Perhaps sticking some online would be appropriate at some point.",Machine Learning: The Art and Science of Algorithms that Make Sense of Data,120.65

173,1107422221,"Flach provides you with a very readable and concise book that covers several vast fields of computation. The subject is big data, to use a recent trendy label. He provides a clear narrative, where you can quickly understand the key underlying ideas. Amusingly, the first chapter has a long example about how to distinguish spam [unwanted bulk mail] from ham [regular mail]. A good pedagogic choice, for you learn about conditional probabilities and Bayes classification. It turns out that Bayesian approaches are common in the entire field of machine learning. So the first chapter correctly confronts this point and educates the reader.I would also point you to Figure 1.7. It is a qualitative 2 dimensional map of the models treated in the text. Models sharing characteristics are close together in the map. You get a top level qualitative appreciation of their properties. Useful when making decisions which to apply.The text also talks about a common problem when dealing with high dimensional data - the curse of dimensionality. As the number of dimensions increases, the data gets sparser. Ideally you want the data to be on a manifold - a surface of lower dimensionality unto which you can project the data prior to further analysis. Of course this just begs the question about how you can detect such a manifold. The book really doesn't say much further other than perhaps to look at a histogram of pairwise distances from a sampling.The section on support vector machines is especially nicely written. It cuts through a lot of jargon that exists in this topic. The geometric visualisation of what you are trying to find - a hyperplane that separates the data into 2 qualitatively different sections - is the main idea to keep in mind.",Machine Learning: The Art and Science of Algorithms that Make Sense of Data,120.65

178,111844714X,"When I saw the title ""Business Analytics"" I thought that this might be a book that targeted MBA students who are uncomfortable with graduate level applied math and statistics. Books that follow this pattern provide a cook book approach to packages that do linear regression or clustering, without providing much background. The virtue of these books is that they tend to be more readable than book likeThe Elements of Statistical Learningby Hastie et al.  Elements of Statistical Learning is a classic but it covers complex topics in a few paragraphs or a page. There are parts of this book that I have read again and again before fully understanding the material.Data Mining with Business Analytics is a much gentler introduction to many of the topics in ""Elements"" (statistical analysis, linear models and clustering, among other topics). Johannes Ledolter writes clearly and walks the fine line of discussing the mathematical background without providing a deep discussion of the mathematics.As the title suggests, the examples are in the R statistical language. I have been using R for several years and have become an R fanboy. I see R as an indispensable platform for doing data analysis.  The R examples are generally well developed. R includes a number of data sets and many authors use these data sets to illustrate analytic techniques. I am starting to feel that the prostate cancer data set, which is used in this book, is getting a bit old and I propose a moratorium on its use.When I studied linear modeling we covered a lot of the mathematical formalism and proofs that this book leaves out. While this did give me a deeper understanding of linear modeling, the cost was some topics, like logistic regression were omitted. This book has a  good chapter on logistic regression.Logistic regression is probably the most popular way to analytically do credit analysis. The logistic regression chapter includes examples of logistic regression applied to lending and credit.The book does not ""talk down"" to the reader. A basic background in statistics is assumed. One of my professors said once that ""MBA students don't like linear algebra"" and I found it interesting that topics like linear regression were presented without linear algebra (e.g., as finite math using summations).The book provides a solid introduction on the techniques and their implementation in R. For anyone using these techniques this will serve as a starting point. For example, the discussion of K-nearest neighbors clustering gives the reader a feel for clustering. For many applications, clustering is more complicated and there are books on this topic.The prices of math and programming books can be hard to swallow. I think that most readers who want an a solid overview of data mining will find that this books does pay back its substantial cost.",Data Mining and Business Analytics with R,113.76
179,111844714X,"This text designed for quantitatively-oriented MBA students is a good second tutorial in R for just about anyone.  It gets to the use of R as a data mining tool for large data sets (something that is often neglected in basic tutorials). Its orientation is toward basic data mining and machine learning techniques.  Enough verbal explanation of each of the techniques is given so that less mathematical students can see the usefulness of each of these methods, and the illustrations are of high enough quality for an expensive textbook.",Data Mining and Business Analytics with R,113.76
180,111844714X,"While this book is expensive, if you know some R already and you are looking for more examples for covering statistical learning/modeling methods, with sample code, this is an excellent buy. If you don't know R you will need to spend a bunch of time getting up to speed before you hit this book.Even though it is targeted at the business world the examples and code are widely applicable. From the table of contents and index you can get a feel for the topics covered. If you want to see the actual code used check the books website.  It is solid and includes the code, the data sets and an errata.  If you are curious to know what R libraries are touched, they  include: arules, car, class, cluster, elipse, igraph, lars, lattice, leaps, locfit, MASS, mixOmics, mixtools, nutsheell, ROCR, startnet, textir, tree and VGAM.This is a pretty book with great well annotated graphics to help you learn.  The writing is pleasantly clear and direct without being too terse. While the code could be better commented (for the R novices) in general it is good and the text which surrounds the code is very good.There are formulas here. The math complements the writing rather than being a deep dive.The references to outside work are on target but the author does not include some obvious choices likeAn Introduction to Statistical Learning: with Applications in R (Springer Texts in Statistics)for a deeper look at the math orData Analysis and Graphics Using R: An Example-Based Approach (Cambridge Series in Statistical and Probabilistic Mathematics)for additional examples.Overall, this is an excellent book for someone who knows basic statistics and the fundamentals of R and who wants to learn modern methods using examples.",Data Mining and Business Analytics with R,113.76

With thousands of public packages in CRAN, it's extensible for many data science tasks.This book covers the use of R for data mining and analysis, and is a great text to learn to use this free software for things like business intelligence.It covers the basic applications and packages quite well and might serve well for people coming over from larger commercial applications.",Data Mining and Business Analytics with R,113.76
183,111844714X,"First off, I'm a pure programmer who is just delving into predictive analytics, and am probably lacking in the statistical theory background that I really ought to be; but I did study math some 25 years ago, so I'm capable of reading fairly following along even fairly technical discussions.  With that said, I did find the discussion here to be very accessible. If you don't know anything about stats and never studied math (or worse, really have an aversion to it), then frankly you should probably stay away from analytics altogether.In this book, R is used to illustrate what is being discussed in analytics and mining, but the book is not about R by any means.  As a puer programmer, I like to know my toolkit inside and out, so I would recommend also purchasing a book about R; the Manning Press books are wonderful and you can download the source code presented in their books too.

184,111844714X,"Data Mining and Business Analytics with R by Johannes Ledolter is a practical and useful introduction to the broad and increasingly important topic of data analytics using the powerful statistical software,R. After recently taking a rigorous MITx EdX data analytics course, I found this book of particular value. The use of the open source statistical software,R, provides a powerful platform for the analysis of large data sets and having book which can take a novice through the steps using many detailed examples is valuable. While the book goes through the R code used in some detail, it would probably be of more value to the reader if they had already been exposed to introductory R.The book contains 19 chapters and covers the essential areas for getting a user up to speed using R for data analytics. Examples of major topics include: Linear Regression (including multivariate analysis); Logistics Regression; Binary Classification; Classification using a Nearest Neighbor (k-Nearest Neighbor Algorithm); Decision Trees; Clustering; and Text Analytics. The book includes a fair amount of the R code used in the examples and many different types of graphs which highlight some of the extensive graphing capabilities found in R. A website link is also provided, allowing the reader to download both the data and the associated R code to either go through the examples or reuse it for other data analytic projects.Overall, I recommend the book for those users who want to fine tune their data analytic capabilities using R.",Data Mining and Business Analytics with R,113.76
185,111844714X,"This is meant to be a practical book. The author's &#34;objective is to provide a thorough discussion of the most useful data-mining tools that goes beyond the typical 'black box' description, and to show why these tools work&#34;. I think the result of reading and doing the exercises in this book is:1. I will have acquired some familiarity with regression techniques and a few of the problems they can help with2. I will have performed the regression techniques in ROver half the text focuses on various kinds of regression. Then there is a little bit on classification, decision trees, clustering, principal components analysis.However, I also think:1. The math is so fast --- mostly one definition after another --- that its inclusion is superfluous. If you know what the equations are, there is no need to see them here. If you don't, this presentation isn't a good way to learn them. These sections often say to check out the author's 2006 text &#34;Introduction to Regression Modeling&#34; for more details.2. The mentions of alternate software (Minitab, SAS, SPSS) are useless throwaways and should either be removed or expanded. Who cares if I have two brands of calculators that give me the same answer for 3 + 4? Likewise, there is no need to say that R gives the same answer as Minitab in a single example (pp. 88-92) or that some feature exists in SAS and SPSS (CHAID, p. 186).3. The exercises are extremely important for practicing.4. Examples sometimes have long program output. In my experience, it takes some practice to read the program output and understand what each number means, and this discussion is not really done in the text.From a statistics perspective, I would instead recommend Tibshirani, Hastie, Friedman: &#34;Elements of Statistical Learning&#34;.

186,111844714X,"I have been using R for my data analysis purposes, however I am not an R programmer, neither a statistician. So receiving this book for review was actually helpful. The book covers practical usage of R libraries for data mining / data analysis / machine learning purposes.The book does not teach how to program R, and most of the time you do not need to. Most R work can be done with the provided IDE as small scripts, and the extensive libraries in CRAN. The other two uses are more complicated: writing R libraries require a good knowledge on the language, and is subject of a different book. And embedding R as a DLL in your application is a simply an &#34;interesting&#34; task requiring learning internal memory models, and strange quirks. But hopefully you'll not need to learn that.Back to the book: The overall coverage seems to be good, and the language, and the flow is sufficient for people who has data mining / machine learning background, but with little previous exposure R. That was exactly for me, and I would recommend the book if you are in a similar situation.",Data Mining and Business Analytics with R,113.76
187,111844714X,"This graduate-level textbook gives students very good exposure to the use of open-source statistical software R in data analysis, data exploration, and data model construction.  Readers must already know some R basics (e.g., how to install R packages, read help files for packages and functions, and work with basic R data structures such as data frames, etc.) and statistical concepts such as hypothesis testing, significance levels, etc.The book chapters are organized mostly around statistical techniques such as linear regression, clustering, text analysis and social network analysis.  Each chapter usually begins with a discussion of concepts important to understanding the statistical technique in question, followed by descriptions of the datasets and R packages to be used in the hands-on problem-solving exercises.  By following along, readers will acquire useful knowledge on what data modeling problem(s) a particular statistical technique can be applied to, what pitfalls (e.g., overfitting) to avoid, how to utilize the covered R packages and use the provided code examples as templates for studying similar problems.The book has an &#34;applied&#34; emphasis -- discussions of the mathematical details underpinning a statistical technique are kept to a minimum and to a relatively high, conceptual, and practical level.  The datasets are quite varied, covering a wide range of domains relevant to the fields of engineering, business and marketing, economics, and health care.All datasets and code examples are available for download from websites mentioned in the book.  The code examples have comments, but there is room for improvement (for example, readers who are relative R novices may not know why a call to set.seed(x) is required before calling some specific R functions).  A similar observation can be made regarding the graphics presented in the book: providing figure captions and, in some cases, better x- and y-axis labeling (for example, instead of just labeling the x-axis with a 0 and a 1, use labels that indicate what the 0 and the 1 represent or mean), in my opinion, could help enhance the reading experience.Overall, however, I thought the book is written at a level that its intended audience will find accessible.",Data Mining and Business Analytics with R,113.76
188,111844714X,"Dr. Ledolter explains in the Introduction that this text is conceived for the education of MBA&#8217;s, a statement that is easily accepted given its lack of rigour, depth and detail.The style is to begin each chapter with a perfunctory review of some elementary technique, such as linear regression, and then demonstrate it with a series of examples and liberal references to R codes.  There is no attempt to present a general theory of the mathematics of data mining and predictive analytics or to help the reader evaluate the relative merits of the techniques discussed.  This dramatically reduces the usefulness of the text.  Far worse, the most powerful data mining methods, based on kernel based statistical learning theory, are almost completely ignored.  Support Vector Machines, for example, are mentioned only in passing because a proper treatment would require explaining too much mathematics!  Of course, if one doesn&#8217;t know or doesn&#8217;t like R, the book is even less useful.In short, this text is little more than a poorly conceived collection of references to R packages that leaves the reader with no genuine understanding of this fascinating field.

194,111866146X,"Having been involved in both electrical power monitoring (very data intensive) and business intelligence software (provides business reports from database sources) for well over a decade now, I agree with the author's premise that there's a difference between data and information. I wrote an article on this subject for the Crystal Reports market, and it's featured on the Crystalkeen Website. Too much of what pretends to be &#34;analysis&#34; or &#34;information&#34; or &#34;business reports&#34; is simply reformatted data and not very useful.Another premise of this author is that the data analysis function serves the business, not the other way around. This point is often lost upon those who are supposed to provide the analysis. Rather than answer business questions, they just provide analysis. Their thinking, such that it is, revolves around the idea that they best do their jobs when they can do the neatest tricks with the analysis system.These are just two examples of several &#34;wrong thinking&#34; ideas that Foreman addresses in this book. Because these &#34;wrong thinking&#34; ideas are pervasive and cause the misallocation of millions of dollars of resources in the typical large company, this book is worth several thousand times its cover price for the typical large company. Scale down the cost as you scale down the enterprise, and the multiplier is obviously less dramatic but still quite potent. Assuming, of course, the reader grasps what Foreman is saying and acts upon those new insights.This assumption has some teeth to it, because Foreman is a very clever writer. In addition to using humor to keep the reader engaged, he apparently labored long and hard over his word choices to get clear meaning across to the reader. This is something I greatly appreciate in a work of nonfiction. Typically, the subject matter expert lacks such a command of English and something gets a bit muffed in the translation from text to the mind of the reader.Now, that's my commentary on the high-level stuff. Which does not comprise the bulk of this book. I addressed it first because, to me, this alone makes this book a &#34;must read&#34; for anyone involved in data analysis, business intelligence, or related fields. Too many in these fields cannot see the forest for the trees, and their penchant for getting mired down in insignificant details shows in the results of their work. They wonder why users waste many hours trying to do their own analysis in Excel, instead of looking at whether they are providing a useful service to the business and its decision-making needs.Let's move on to the technical stuff covered in this book. At one time in my career, I was a spreadsheet junkie. I built very complex models in Excel. So I was delighted to walk through Foreman's examples and tutorials on using Excel to do various kinds of analysis. These examples and tutorials comprise the bulk of this book, but they are not the point of the book.Let me explain by analogy. I'm not sure if this reaches the typical reader, but try to follow (and accept my apologies if it's a dud). In electrical engineering today, software does the number crunching for you. But in engineering school (and often in the friendly debates engineers have), the modus is on manually doing the calculations. When you read the electrical engineering trade publications, you find not an admonition to run the example through your software but you find manual calculations being walked through.The reason, in all instances, is the participants must be able to understand the concepts. You can do this only by crunching the numbers yourself and following along in the mental processes of arriving at the answer. So the author of an article might provide quite a trail of calculation to prove a point. It's the point that matters, not the calculation per se. But you don't get the point unless you can see how it's arrived at.For example, in this book Foreman discusses K-analysis. How can you really understand this without working through some examples and watching the effects on the data? Answer: You can't.To me, being walked through this litany of hard-to-grasp data analysis concepts is the only way a person can really understand those concepts. I think a mere surface knowledge is insufficient (a little knowledge is dangerous....). Even outside the realm of data analysis, people toss about terms they clearly do not understand but think they do. But based on my many years interacting with Crystal Reports administrators and trainers, I think the problem is especially pernicious in this particular  field of data analysis. If you really want to know what you're talking about, you need to do the learning work.The first nine chapters walk the reader through data analysis concepts. Chapter 10 is an introduction to an analysis program called R. Foreman begins by summing up the previous nine chapters as an exercise in learning analytics and then making it clear that Excel isn't the right tool for actually doing analytics.I don't believe Foreman is trying to &#34;sell&#34; R per se. It's what he's familiar with. There are other tools for data analysis, including the big players in the Business Intelligence (BI) market, such as Crystal Reports and Cognos. Basically, if you want an effective, accurate, efficient way to answer business decision-making questions from the data your business gathers, you need to step up to a tool designed for that job. And, of course, you need an adequate database behind it.Foreman has excellent advise in his 11th chapter (which is not numbered), &#34;Conclusion.&#34; It's only six pages long, but what he says in here is profound. If you, as the reader, grasp nothing else but what's in this conclusion, the book has served you well.",Data Smart: Using Data Science to Transform Information into Insight,26.77
195,111866146X,"Foreman is an engaging writer.This book is aimed at someone like me, someone with a long-ago background in college statistics and a current general familiarity with Microsoft Excel.  Foreman uses Excel skillfully as a teaching tool. He demonstrates repeatedly how, using Excel, it is possible to piece together hundreds (or thousands) of data micro-bits to create useful statistical predictions.Foreman does not claim that Excel is an optimal tool for large data science projects. Data science professionals will prefer other tools (like the R language) for large-scale projects involving millions of records. Still, all by itself, Excel is serviceable for smaller-scale data science projects. And, as Foreman shows, Excel is useful as a teaching tool, to illustrate otherwise-difficult statistical concepts.The book is well-written and useful.

If you need to produce reports for sales or you own a small business and want your basic BI, this book is great. However, once you start working with large enterprise level data sets with millions of rows and hundreds of columns of information, Excel becomes useless.The samples the author provides are very tiny sample sets compared to what most people need to use, and the 'Solver' add-in only works on these very small sample sets. If you have over 4 or 5 variables, you will receive an error, which makes the solutions the author provides basically useless for larger data sets - any BI you extract will not be from this method of doing things.",Data Smart: Using Data Science to Transform Information into Insight,26.77

It is ideally suited for under-graduates, but anyone will find it immensely useful to get their feet wet with machine learning!The author has excellent style of communication and his examples are simple and clear. The Math is explained in painstaking detail (even matrix multiplication). Advanced readers can easily skip these explanations, but novices will find them really useful.Added to that, the author has taken the extra effort to code up everything in python and has provided the code to play around with! (This book could also be a fun introduction to python, which is a lovely language to learn.) Many times you read some algorithm and try to implement the pseudo-code, only to find that it takes hours for you to make it work. Something as simple as linear regression could turn out to be a pain, if you have incorrect step sizes! Many books simply say ""use a small value"" for the step size, and you are wondering whether 2 is small or 0.001 is small! But this book goes one step further, and says, what value of step size to use for the example, so you first get something to work before you experiment with it.If you are teaching an under-grad CS course/introductory CS grad course on machine learning, then this is the book you need to use.

198,1420067184,"There are two or three things that I really like about this book.First, so many books of this type seem to leave off the first 20 or so pages that should tell you what it is that they are trying to do. Instead of assuming that you know what Machine Learning is all about, this book has an initial chapter that explains in simple terms what we are trying to do here.Second, instead us using some kind of psuedocode, the examples are written in a standard language, Python. Python is a free language in the open source community so students can get/use it without incurring the costs associated with some other languages. It is also intended to be very readable which makes the demonstration programs easier to understand. There is also a chapter on programming in Python.Machine learning usually is put into the computer science department in universities, and as a result is usually taught to computer science students. In fact, machine learning also requires more mathematical background and more engineering background than most computer science students have. The approach used in this book is to discuss algorithms used in machine learning, but to do so by stressing how and why they work.The author says that the book is suitable for undergraduate use.

201,1420067184,"This book has sat in my Amazon Wish List for several years. I always put off buying it - until I actually needed a machine learning book.Pros: Unlike too many technical books, the author of this book is not trying to display his brilliance. This is a nuts and bolts book - not a cookbook, but not a Springer-style book of axioms, either. Reading this book reminded me of school. There seem to be two kinds of professors - one kind tends to prefer examples and problems that display some sort of first principle or other basic and fundamental problem. These professors are good at teaching new concepts, but sometimes fail at teaching the practicalities. The other kind of professor favors practical problems and how-do-I-do-this-for-real issues. This book sits firmly in the latter camp.Cons: As mentioned above, this book is not a cookbook, and yet is also is not rigorous. For such a practical book, I would have wanted more pseudocode and algorithms. For example, near the end of the book, the author goes over Kalman filters and particle filters. He gives one algorithm for a Kalman filter (whith no treatment to the different kinda and uses of Kalman fitlers), and only a slight description of a particle fitler (and no pseudocode). To be fair, books and volumes are to be had on the subject. But, I was left wanting more.This book is a good introduction to how to use various aspects and techniques of machine learning. If you a looking for mathematical rigour, look elsewhere. If you are looking for cookbook-style algorithms, use this book in supplement. If you want a practical overview of machine learning methods before setting on your course, buy this book.Recommended, but with qualification.",Machine Learning: An Algorithmic Perspective (Chapman &amp; Hall/Crc Machine Learning &amp; Pattern Recognition),40.5
202,1420067184,"I chose to use this book for a course on machine-learning for computer scientists that I taught in the spring of 2011.The main reason for selecting it involved its use of the python language, and a more overall programming-orientedapproach to machine learning. I do believe the author has the right idea, assuming the targeted audience is cs majors whoneed some basic introductory exposure to the subject. Yes, the author does walk a fine line between trying to provide somedegree of mathematical rigor, and yet not overwhelming the student with too many equations. In doing so, he trips and stumblesseveral times throughout the text, but, in the end, I do believe that the average undergraduate would benefit from this bookmore so than from a more traditional math-oriented ML book. So it does fill a niche in the ML literature. To improve the book,say, for the next edition, I would suggest toning down the ""cs students need to have their hands held when doing math""attitude that is purveyed throughout the text, and adding a bit more rigor where needed.Also, I found much of the python matrix code very slick and often hard to follow. For this reason, the final chapter oughtto be the first read (for those students with no python background) and more examples and exercises should be giventhat reinforce the matrix manipulations. I also suggest that the next edition include more problems at the end of each chapter,and simple exercises throughout the reading,especially ones that help students practice both the mathematics and the programming. Having lots of exercises can help smoothout some of the discontinuities that are found throughout the text. By ""discontinuities"", I mean at times taking large leaps fromintuitive wordy explanations, followed by jumping into the mathematical models.A great example of a textbook that succeeds in walking the above tight rope is ""Theory of Computation"", by Michael Sipser.Every future author who wants to balance accessibility and rigor ought to first read this book for inspiration. Anothergreat success story is Mitzenmacher's ""Probability and Computing"". So it can be done!

207,1439810184,"If you are on a journey to become a data scientist, do yourself a favor and pick up a copy of this book.Since R is an open source language with a strong community, there is no dearth of information and tutorials which will help the beginner quickly get up to speed (I highly recommend 'R Cookbook' by Paul Teetor).What was lacking, in my opinion, was a book targeted at practitioners. A book which you can pick up and start using R in your work. A book which will compress the learning curve and equip you for real world mastery - to the point where, perhaps, you might head straight to Kaggle.com and take part in data mining competitions.The book by Luis Torgo admirably fills this gap. In the context of the case studies, the author painstakingly describes the challenges one would face in real life - such as - how to go about cleaning and munging the data, how to visualize and summarize the data, how to come up with plausible hypothesis and test them. Since data mining is as much art as science, this kind of approach where you see an expert in action and see how they go about making design choices is highly educational.Along the tour, you also learn about several popular add-on libraries such as xts, rocr and hmisc.Once again, an excellent how-to book and highly recommended as your 2nd R book.Ravi Aranke (longtaildata.com)",Data Mining with R: Learning with Case Studies (Chapman &amp; Hall/CRC Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery Series),34.0
208,1439810184,"The book starts with an Introduction to R. Nicely written, it explains concepts that are needed to use this programming language for data mining. The book is then divided in four case studies. Each case study introduces data mining concepts that are illustrated using R.First, pre-processing and data visualization are introduced through the prediction of algae blooms. Second, come the modelling and time ordering with the stock market application. Then, outlier detection and clustering are presented through fraud detection. Finally, feature selection and cross-validation are introduced through the classification of microarray samples. There is no introduction to data mining, but it's not a problem since concepts are explained through the different case studies.Theoretical concepts are always linked to examples. This is the case for most of the data mining books. Luis goes a step further by linking each application to the corresponding code in R. It is thus easy to both understand a concept as well as implementing it with R. This is certainly one of the best book for a direct implementation of data mining algorithms. Another good point of the book is that for most of the problems there are different ways to solve them.I have one remark regarding the stock market prediction chapter. I have already discussed this issue when I was working in finance. The author states that the percentage of profitable trades should be above 50% to have a successful trading strategy. This is not always the case. Imagine a system where each winning trade brings $2 while loosing trades costs $1. Since you can earn more money with winning trades than what you loose with loosing trades, you can thus still have a successful trading strategy with 48% of winning trades, for example.As a conclusion, this is an invaluable resource for data miners, R programmers as well as people involved in fields such as fraud detection and stock market prediction.

But as a programming language, it has a steep learning curve, at least steeper than many of the more traditional GUI-based tools for quantitative and statistical analysis like SPSS or even SAS.  This book provides a great introduction to both the topic of data mining and using the Rattle interface, which is a GUI built around typical data mining functions for the R language.  If you work through this book in detail, you will learn a fair bit the basics of the R language as well as how to complete some basic data mining tasks inside the Rattle interface.

211,1441998896,"The book presents a very good introduction to the practice of data analysis, focusing on data mining techniques. The first part covers the essential steps in data analysis, including data loading, cleaning and preparation. Dividing your data in two different subsets for training and evaluation is an important aspect emphasized in this part. The second part takes a tour over popular data mining techniques such as clustering, association or SVM from a practical point of view. Finally, the last part describes model evaluation and deployment.The author has created an open source R library (Rattle) that offers a graphical interface to explore all methods and techniques described in the book. This is a invaluable asset to follow the examples and explanations in the book, specially for those readers that are not quite familiarized with R yet. In this regard, all low level commands can also be consulted in the log tab of the interface, allowing unexperienced readers to learn about R programming and the underlying libraries used throughout the process.In my opinion, the combination of a very readable book and the R graphical interface makes it quite an attractive option for introductory courses in data mining, or as a self-study reference to learn about the implementation of popular data mining techniques in R.",Data Mining with Rattle and R: The Art of Excavating Data for Knowledge Discovery (Use R!),30.4

213,1441998896,"I am so happy I decided to buy this book. From the first page it is clear the author writes in excellent, approachable style -- there is no single place where I could find the author shows off his knowledge, nope, Graham Williams really teaches so the reader could understand. He allows to make friends with data mining in painless way; I appreciate the fact the first approach to each technique is done via GUI frontend (Rattle), but then the internals of R are explained -- the name of the package is given, how Rattle calls this or that function behind the scene, and also how to interpret the outcome, so in the end it is not only about the clicking with mouse.I find this book very valuable for two reasons -- the comfort it provides (scientific book, and you want to read more and more), and it helps you focus on modeling the data, tweaking, etc (big plus for emphasis on training, validation and testing the models). However it is introductory book (I just can wish every introductory book was so informative and friendly). It is not related to the topic of data mining, but I noticed with pleasure the clear voice for open implementations of algorithms -- I can only concur that public reviews and collaboration allow to move things forward in faster pace.If you would like to learn by example what the data mining is, how to apply, compare various algorithms this is the book for you. If you already know that and you would like to translate your knowledge to R, to some degree I would also recommend this book. This is not a book for learning R per se, so if you don't know the R it won't teach you that (rather make you a bit familiar), but don't worry, you can stick with GUI.The book is not perfect though. From time to time I missed explanation of the outcomes presented in the book -- the author does not have to spell out for me that I am looking at number ""0.74"", but the tip what does it mean is valuable (i.e. there are such explanations, but not in every desired place, at least by me). Second -- I would love to see more discussion about tough cases and how to handle them. Even such extremes, that surprised the author himself. Mistakes he did, the graphs that led him in the wrong direction, and so on. Such issues here are just lightly touched, not enough for my taste.The biggest complain is not about the content itself, but the way Springer published this book. OK, it is in color, I love it, and I am grateful. But thanks to shiny paper and weird binding, not only I couldn't put this book flat but with every page turn I had to maneuver to kill the glare. In this regard, I can say it was unpleasant experience, because of arm fatigue (book is heavy!) and all the trouble.Don't let those problems detract your from paying attention to this book -- if you are curious about data mining, or interested in it, and you are not an expert already -- solid buy!",Data Mining with Rattle and R: The Art of Excavating Data for Knowledge Discovery (Use R!),30.4

Unfortunately, I ran into issues that others mentioned regarding the heavy focus on data manipulation in R rather than machine learning.  I happened to buy an R book along with this one as part of a 2 for 1 promotion, and it was a good thing I did.  I'm now having to basically take a break from the MLFH book to read a few chapters of the R book so that I can follow along without having to break my concentration so much to figure out why my R code isn't working the way it's supposed to (Update: According to some of the other reviewers, the problem may be that the code in the book is simply buggy. Talk about a recipe for frustration!).  Also, since the companion code is stored on Github, which I had not used before, I wasted a lot of time learning Github, especially when it came time to update my versions of the code with the author's updated versions.  At the very least, the authors could have included a simple set of instructions on how to fork, pull, merge, etc. for this specific repository.Don't even get me started on the issues with Chapter 11.  In my eagerness, I skipped from Chapter 3 to Chapter 11 because I wanted to learn about working with social network data.  They might as well remove the chapter if they're not going to update it to reflect the changes (little warning boxes in the book are not sufficient).

Drew and John have written an excellent book on presenting machine learning concepts like classification, clustering, recommendation, network graphs, and SVMs to name a few.  The authors do a great job of presenting how to apply these machine learning algorithms and explain the general concepts of the algorithms, which is the focus of the book.  If you are looking for a book that provides an in depth coverage of machine learning algorithms, then this is not the book for you.  In addition, the authors do provide some explanation of the R scripting language that they use throughout the book to apply the machine learning algorithms to different data sets.  They provide some depth of what the code is doing, but by no means is this a book that explains the details of the R language (not the authors intent).  If you have developed software in other languages like Python, then you should find yourself able to follow and execute the examples that they walk you through in the book.  Therefore, if you are looking for a book that will provide an understanding of the R language, then you will want to look at other books that are focused on the R language.  O'Reilly has many book that provide the detailed explanation of the R language and is the focus of those books.  Again it is not the intent of the authors to either provide in depth coverage of machine learning or the R language, but to demonstrate machine learning using the R language which they have done very well.  I really enjoyed working through the examples and learning how easy it is to utilize the extensive library of algorithms that the R language provides.Therefore, if you are new to machine learning and are familiar with reading either R or another scripting language, then you will enjoy this book.  You might find yourself needing to search the internet for more detailed explanation of the machine learning algorithms, but you will still enjoy how simple they are able to be implemented in the R language by using the extensive library of algorithms.  You will enjoy this book even more if you are interested in both the R language and Machine learning, since that is the focus of the book.

Key to real machine learning is Bayesian statistics, combining data driven probabilities with prior knowledge. Examples such as determining a person&#8217;s gender from &#8216;her height and weight&#8217; (a she maybe?) are easy to envisage in more pertinent domains such as deriving lithology from seismic attributes and logs, or in root cause analysis of maintenance data.R&#8217;s capability to work on text analytics is demonstrated in the Bayesian spam detector. A single line of code removes &#8216;stop words,&#8217; further natural language processing performs word counts and more statistics to separate the spam from the ham. Again&#8212;industrial use cases of such techniques abound.

I thought that this book could provide me with a good entry and could be a newer, more up-to-date approach than the classic Programming Collective Intelligence by Toby Segaran. Nonetheless I was a bit surprised to realize that the hackers' language should be R instead of Python - so this meant that the book would also serve me as an intro to R.

Typical starter exercises of ML are well versed: Bayesian spam filtering, weighting schemes for ranking, regression, overfitting and optimization is explained and demonstrated with a down-to-earth and hands-on approach. The authors also touch some of the more complex topics: principal components analysis, multidimensional scaling and the k-nearest neighbours algorithm are introduced with real world data. I was really delighted to see a longer chapter dedicated to social graph analysis and I totally give kudos for the inclusion of Gephi, the powerful open source graph visualization and manipulation software that I also enjoy using more and more.The authors come from a social science background and although this book seems to be avoiding 'programming' or providing code that could be incorporated in a runtime environment, I believe the goal they set, to provide machine learning tools for tinkering, has been reached with great success. It's short, concise and not scary at all.",Machine Learning for Hackers,40.27
221,1449303714,"I started my journey in the machine learning / data mining field thanks to curiosity generated by Toby Segaran's classicProgramming Collective Intelligence: Building Smart Web 2.0 Applications. The book by Drew Conway and John White continues in the same excellent tradition. It presents case studies which are interesting enough that you can appreciate them without too much domain knowledge and without getting too deep into technical nitty-gritty. At the same time, the case studies are meaty enough that you can adapt them to real life problems and hack together a quick working prototype in your practice.By many estimates (and my own experience), 80% of time in machine learning is spent in data cleaning and exploratory data analysis. This book has very good coverage of both areas. Authors use Hadley Wickham's excellent packages viz. ggplot2, plyr and reshape2. If you are doing serious exploratory data analysis in R, these packages are a must and the book does a great job in showing them in action.The reason I suffixed the review with 'if you know a little R' is that data cleansing requires one to be fairly comfortable with somewhat arcane R syntax. If you don't know any R at all, it would be helpful to get a more gentle introduction - such asR Cookbook (O'Reilly Cookbooks)- before you tackle this book.In summary, this is an excellent 2nd book on R to have as you try to deploy machine learning in real life.BTW, if you are looking for 3rd R book, my vote isData Mining with R: Learning with Case Studies (Chapman & Hall/CRC Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery Series)",Machine Learning for Hackers,40.27
222,1449303714,"By page count, this is primarily a book on R, with some additional time spent on machine learning.There is way too much time spent on R, dedicated to such things as parsing email messages, and spidering webpages, etc. These are things that no-one with other tools available would do in R. And it's not that it's easier to do it in R, it's actually harder than using an appropriate library, like JavaMail. And yet, while much time is spent in details, like regexes to extract dates (ick!), more interesting R functions are given short shrift.There's some good material in here, but it's buried under the weight of doing everything in R. If you are a non-programmer, and want to use only one hammer for everything, then R is not a bad choice. But it's not a good choice for developers that are already comfortable with a wider variety of tools.I'd recommendProgramming Collective Intelligenceby Segaran, if you would describe yourself as a ""Hacker"".",Machine Learning for Hackers,40.27

224,1449358659,"It is the most difficult to digest and comprehend book to date out of what I have recently read. It is even fun though at the same time. I guess I need to blame myself because this book unexpectedly turned out to be more from the Academia world where my skills in Algebra and Statistics faded out over time than from the practical world. At the same time it was pleasant to feel a student again.Nevertheless, the book offers a ton of insight, and how-to&#8217;s for the in &#8220;the trenches&#8221; practitioners. This book is full of external reference and facts, it sure took a while for the authors to assemble it.From my observations, the knowledge of the R language is necessary before starting reading, sadly, even if a program code is provided in the book there is no sample output.The book is written so it has chapters by guest authors, this makes sense as a data project is rarely comprised of one kind of a professional, this nuance is also covered in the book by the way.These guest authors are top notch professionals that would write a complete book on their own subject matter of expertise. But because they are the &#8220;top guns&#8221; in their corresponding field each managed to cover a lot of grounds just within a dedicated single chapter.So, in short, the best thing about this book is that in one single investment you get a comprehensive coverage for life on what approach or algorithm to use against a given data science task at hand. You must feel more secure after reading this book and as a result be more eager and ready to embark on any data science project.Five out of five stars.Disclaimer: I received this book for free as part of O&#8217;Reilly Blogger Review program.",Doing Data Science: Straight Talk from the Frontline,26.67
225,1449358659,"... helps the medicine go down, as Mary Poppins used to say. An IT-focused publisher, O'Reilly has twice before used the ""book as collection of chapters by different contributors"" formula in its foray into the attractive ""data"" niche, with such titles as ""Beautiful data"" and ""Bad data"". ""Doing data science"" - by the way, I prefer Hastie and Tibshirani's ""statistical learning"" to the fuzzy and grandiose ""data science"" - follows the same approach, but, with its subject matter being closer to the academe, the company enlisted two young PhDs to steer the collaborative effort. Rachel Schutt took the lead as author and editor, and, assisted by Cathy O'Neil, produced an engaging, informal - you don't often see ""science"" in the title and ""huge-ass"" in the text - yet sufficiently technical to be hands-on, sequence-of-vignettes-styled book. Imagine a mash-up of a magazine article and a textbook. Neither part may be best-in-class, but their combination makes for a ""unique selling proposition"".Well, maybe not a textbook. Most textbooks are carefully written and carefully checked. In contrast, when I see ""Doing data science"" introduce  the ROC curve in three places, one of which translates the ""O"" as ""operator"", I can guess that this is a copy-paste of papers by three contributors. When Dr. O'Neil casually redefines an English word (""causal"") to avoid rewriting a couple of sentences, or pronounces, on page 159, that ""priors reduce degrees of freedom"" - this is painfully meaningless, and neither term is defined, only name-checked - I suspect that she knows better, but just did not feel like spending more time on her half-chapter. Neither author speaks of their own projects - if this is the ""frontline"", then it's other soldiers' ""trenches"" that we are visiting. The occasional code listings are borrowed as well, thrown in without editing or comments. In this last regard, ""Doing data science"" lags far behind the book that seems to have informed its choice of topics, Peter Harrington's ""Machine learning in action"". (That's one suggestion - and if you want a good, accessible textbook, ""Introduction to statistical learning"" by James et al. is another).None of it is going to matter to the book's target audience. ""Doing data science"" is aimed at beginners - and is bound to be interesting and useful to thousands of keen undergrads and adult learners.",Doing Data Science: Straight Talk from the Frontline,26.67
226,1449358659,"&#8220;Data Science&#8221; has become one of the most trendy research fields in recent years, as well as a catchall rubric for various job descriptions and work functions. The cynics and skeptics, and there are many of those, contend that &#8220;Data Science&#8221; is nothing more than repackaged Statistics, with a bit of coding and hacking thrown in. Its proponents, however, point out that most practicing data scientists use a variety of skills and techniques in their daily work, and come from a vast spectrum of career paths and backgrounds. I tend to side with the latter group, but I too am an outsider to this field and am still trying to get a better understanding of what it really entails.&#8220;Doing Data Science: Straight Talk from the Frontline&#8221; is a compendium of chapters that deal with data science as it is practiced in the real world. Each chapter is written by a different author, all of who have significant practical experience and are acknowledged authorities on data science. Most of the contributors work in industry, but data science is still so fresh and new that there is a lot of crossing over between academia and the corporate world.A few of the chapters include exercises, but these tend to be too advanced and assume too much background material for an introductory book. The exercises still give you a good idea of what kinds of problems data scientists tend to grapple with. However, this book is definitely not a textbook and cannot be effectively used as such. The book doesn&#8217;t provide any background on R, statistics, data scrubbing, machine learning, and various other techniques used by data scientist. It is highly unlikely that any single textbook would be able to do justice to all of that material anyways, but a book of that sort could still have a lot of potential use.There are two groups of people who would benefit from this book. The first are people who have absolutely no background in data science or any of its related fields, but would like to get a flavor of what data science is all about and are interested in exploring it for career purposes. The second group are people with significant technical background in one of the fields related to data science (programming, statistics, machine learning, etc.) who are interested in broadening their skills and would like to see how would their particular strengths fit within the broader data science field.",Doing Data Science: Straight Talk from the Frontline,26.67
227,1449358659,"This is a beautiful, thoughtful survey with excellent references.  I am an academic data scientist with nearly 20 years experience and I wanted a book to offer my students who are starting in the field.  This is it.The ""difficulty"" with data science is in the breadth of skills that are needed. Because data scientists need training in art, communication, statistics, and programming nobody is prepared to handle all the tasks and the neophyte (and expert) will need to fill in around their weaknesses.  This book does a brilliant job of working around that issue.  The writing is superb for a beginning to intermediate reader and the graphics and aside boxes are engaging.  More importantly. the references are plentiful and spot on.  In the areas I know well the authors suggest the things I recommend and where I am weak the recommendations have proven interesting.While this is a broad survey, there is some depth here.  There are formulas throughout but the book does not get bogged down in proofs and derivations.  There are programs written in R code scattered throughout.  The code is nicely commented but there is not a deep dive into how it words.  So, the reader who knows some R will learn a few new tricks but it does not interrupt the flow of the book.A reader who types the R code will run into problems.  Clearly the authors/editors did not attempt to run the code after the type setter mangled it.  For example, on page 39 there is a line which begins with a + and that character needed to be on the previous line.  In other places, (like page 49) functions are invoked (count) but the authors have not included the commands to make the functions available (in this case library(plyr)).  Sadly there does not seem to be an errata for the book and these will be major headaches or show stoppers for novices.While this book could be improved with a code supplement on the web (including the code to make all the graphics, complete solutions to the example/problems and an errata), this is a wonderful buy for readers of all levels.",Doing Data Science: Straight Talk from the Frontline,26.67
228,1449358659,"Doing Data Science is about the practice of data science, not its implementation. It is based on a course on data science that featured a guest lecturer on each topic. This leads to the guest lecturers (and chapters) focusing more on important concepts rather then the methodology. So, this is not a textbook or a how-to-do-this type of book, rather it is a how-to-think-when-doing book.A problem with books like this where each chapter is written by someone different is the need for coherence. A second is that each author typically has something to day, and she has to say it in her chapter. So, compared to other data science books, it suffers from the chapters not building on each other in a systematic way and having multiple messages that appear as you go through the book.One benefit from this is that each author has something to say. While I find the book thin on how to do things, this is a good source of wisdom in why things are done and issues that come up along the way in real life. I am teaching data science for the first time and I find myself turning here for topics of discussion which my chosen textbooks don't cover (as they have more focus on how to do things).I don't think this is the book to use to learn how to do data science, and I suspect the students at Columbia learned how to find other sources to help them figure things out.

229,1449358659,"""Doing Data Science: Straight Talk from the Frontline"" by Cathy O&#8217;Neil and Rachel Schutt; O'Reilly MediaWith so many books being published on Data, from Big Data to Machine Learning to Data Analysis, we must ask what yet another book is going to offer us.  And the answer is not that much.  O&#8217;Neil and Schutt have seemingly written this to give us a view of how the ins and outs of the actual world of Data Science are practiced.  But we get little more than an overview of what Data Analysis is in general.Many topics a reader might find interesting, whether for background knowledge or otherwise, are given little emphasis, and even then, without much depth.  As an example, a discussion on the Exponential Distribution merely states that &#8220;because we are familiar with the fact that &#8216;waiting time&#8217; is a common enough real-world phenomenon that a distribution called the exponential distribution has been invented to describe it.&#8221;  Any mathematician realizes that inventing probability distributions are a little more involved than is implied.The main part of the book starts with a look at algorithms.  The authors use R as their primary language.  There is little in terms of explanation of the underlying processes and examples are pretty direct.  Nave Bayes, for example, is explained in a page and a half, so we can clearly say that this is an overview of many of the ideas going into Data Science.  In fact it is a very wide overview.  Financial Modelling, Spam Filtering, Epidemiology, the list goes on.  This is definitely a plus; we see the wide applications that Data Science has.The book ends with a discussion on Competitions, but we come back to the question of what we have gained more than we might get by a simple perusal of the web?  Maybe I was hoping for more out of the book than I got; expectations can be a killer.  But in the end we must make a choice.  If we would like to know about Data Science &#8211; how it&#8217;s done &#8211; then we would probably like to look elsewhere.  If we would like to have some book that we can show someone what areas exist within this field and what topics are touched upon in it (perhaps for an advisor), then this book should do fine.(FTC disclosure (16 CFR Part 255): The reviewer has accepted a reviewer's copy of this book which is his to keep.

For me this approach worked very well; after trawling through endless examples and documents of the data science flavour of the year map reduce I can finally say that I understand the process. Of course if you are labouring under a pointy haired boss who has heard the term data science in a meeting and is pressing you to use all its latest and greatest techniques this approach may seem a bit frivolous, but it&#8217;s well worth the investment. Understanding the process will speed up your implementations and will also inform you as to what approaches are valid with what you want to do.

Today there is a tremendous demand for everything ""Data Science"", Companies need ""Data scientists"", IT resources are refocusing themselves to be the ""Data scientists"".  Contrary to popular beliefs that Marketing benefits a lot from data science, companies are finding benefits across the spectrum of their operations .

It is a text book and authors have taken lot of care so general audience can also benefit from it, and also not to dilute it's textbook value. To get the full benefit of the book, read about 50 pages  ( Do not flip pages), never more than 10 -15 pages per session. The book is intense so you will need to take a break in between or will lose the thread. Once you are finished with fifteen pages, go to the first page and read , highlight the important areas and  then go to the next page. So plan to read this book in a span of 2 -3 months. I know it is slow but if you want to understand the inner workings of ""Data science"", there is not much other option. Alternative is to flip across several superficial articles that is a staple diet of every blog and magazines.WHAT THIS BOOK WILL DELIVER ?When you are finished with the book, you should have a fairly good understanding of data science, For example, what type of analysis that needs to be done to identifyA.

237,1449361323,"As the authors discuss in the preface to this text, the content presented here provides a conceptual foundation for many well-known data mining algorithms, and is therefore not about algorithms or a replacement for a book about algorithms. ""We believe there is a relatively small set of fundamental concepts or principles that underlie techniques for extracting useful knowledge from data."" While this book does contain significant technical content, the conceptual approach that the authors take revolves around (1) how data science fits in the organization and the competitive landscape, (2) ways of thinking data-analytically, which help identify appropriate data and consider appropriate methods, and (3) discussions on extracting the knowledge from data that undergirds the vast array of data science tasks and algorithms.Content is broken down into 14 chapters, followed by two appendixes which outline factors to consider when assessing potential data mining projects and provide another sample proposal beyond what was presented in Chapter 13 (""Data Science and Business Strategy""). After providing an introduction to data-analytic thinking, the authors present discussions on the following topics: the data mining process, supervised versus unsupervised data mining, identifying informative attributes, segmenting data by progressive attribute selection, fitting a model to data, overfitting and its avoidance, similarity, neighbors, and clusters, model evaluation, model performance, evidence and probabilities, representing and mining text, and analytical engineering, followed by some additional tasks and techniques which build on the foundation presented in earlier chapters, and a discussion of data science and strategy.The content that the authors present will likely be weighty for many potential readers. While I do agree with the authors that the math is kept to a minimum, this weightiness will likely be due to the number of topics that are discussed as well as the detail of many of the discussions. In short, most will not find this book a short read, although I did find it curious how many book reviews were written so soon after the publish date. Readers who do not have time to read the entire text but are interested in this space might at minimum be advised to read Chapter 1 (""Introduction: Data-Analytic Thinking""), Chapter 2 (""Business Problems and Data Science Solutions""), and Chapter 13 (""Data Science and Business Strategy""), followed by the appendixes, before moving forward to the remaining chapters where a bulk of the material is presented.As a consultant architect, I especially appreciated the discussion in Chapter 1 (""Introduction: Data-Analytic Thinking"") on where data science fits in the context of other data-related processes in the organization, as well as its relationship with Big Data (it is refreshing to read material that presents the correct definition of the term, unlike some other publications in this space). In addition, I enjoyed the discussions in Chapter 7 (""Decision Analytic Thinking I: What Is a Good Model?"") and Chapter 11 (""Decision Analytic Thinking II: Toward Analytical Engineering""). The other chapters that I especially appreciate include Chapter 3 (""Introduction to Predictive Modeling: From Correlation to Supervised Segmentation""), Chapter 4 (""Fitting a Model to Data""), Chapter 5 (""Overfitting and its Avoidance""), and Chapter 6 (""Similarity, Neighbors, and Clusters""). And now that I have listed these favorites, I realize that together they comprise half the text.While I understand that this book is based on an MBA course that Provost taught at NYU over the past ten years, and ""The Wall Street Journal"" discussed just today that analytics is starting to be increasingly prevalent in MBA coursework, I am impressed at the level of detail in some of the discussions that the authors present, even though the varying language used in some of the segments seems to point to several different authors. As a visual thinker, however, it is the abundant level of diagrams that continued to grab my attention and bring me to understand them in light of the textual component of the discussions.

The introduction says that one of the best uses based on feedback has been for professionals who aren't involved in data science to bone up enough to be able to assess and hire a data science professional.  That approach, providing a good level of information for someone who is not a data scientist but who has to work with them, gives a good feel for what this book is.The book is broken into chapters, each of which discusses some aspect of data science.  At the end of each chapter is a one page summary.  For a very quick overview of data science, it is possible to read through the 12 chapter summaries, and then read the last two chapters which bring together concepts from the book.  Then, the entire in depth chapter is there for reference, as you have to apply what you've read.  That's what I did anyway - read the chapter summaries and then went back and read portions of chapters.  I feel like this gave me a good overview of the topic, and then I have the in depth material available.

It was written as a collaboration between a data scientist who teaches MBA's and business professionals, and a PhD researcher in Machine Learning who has applied these techniques in leading technology firms.In my opinion it is the best book on Data Science and Big Data for a professional understanding by business analysts and managers who must apply these techniques in the practical world.  One intention omission that is best filled by another handbook is on the data processing tools that are applied inexploiting these well explained principles: NoSql Databases, Hadoop, Scripting Languages such as Python, and Statistical Shells such as Weka, Orange, R and Matlab.--Ira Laefsky MS Engineering, MBA Information Technology Consultant and Physiological Computing Researcherformerly on the Senior Consulting Staff of Arthur D.

244,1449361323,"This is an excellent introduction to Data Science for the person who wants to gain a good understanding of the subject and what it can do for business. The authors&#8217; language is straightforward and they have attempted to simplify statistical nomenclature to avoid losing their less statistically qualified readers.Provost and Fawcett have put together a very accessible guide that explains what Data Science is and what it is not. Their work is realistic and practical. The book presents the theory behind the subject and includes practical applications that enhance the reader&#8217;s understanding. Provost and Fawcett are excellent at swiping away myths on the subject, myths that some commercial promoters of the subject may like to maintain.  The power of Data Science is amazing enough without reliance on myth.  The authors clearly state that Data Science is not the panacea for all ills, and that it cannot succeed without the understanding of people.Not only does this book deal with the theoretical and technical concepts of the subject, but it discusses how the discipline can work within an organisation and with such issues as data privacy.It is seldom one finds a book that is so clear and comprehensive.",Data Science for Business: What you need to know about data mining and data-analytic thinking,31.89

249,1449361323,"Companies to compete today are seeking new ways to dramatically improve operational efficiency, increase revenues, rapidly develop and bring innovative products to market. As a result, data science principles and data mining techniques are being expanded and applied at an ever increasing rate to support these strategies. Almost every industry is investing in the exploitation of data to find any competitive advantage it can.To help those less conversant on these new tools, authors Foster Provost and Tom Fawcett have produced ""Data Science for Business."" This will be a particularly useful book for business people who will be working in the field, business people (like me) who just want a basic understanding of how it can be and should be used, developers who will be implementing solutions, candidates for data science jobs, and, of course, their hiring managers. The book is a product of Provost and Fawcett's applying data science to real business problems for more than two decades. It was introduced by Provost as a textbook for New York University's Stern School in 2005.This is not a book about algorithms or an instructional manual on how to find data solutions for particular problems but rather an introduction to a small set of fundamental concepts that underlie techniques for extracting useful knowledge from data. These provide the foundation and building blocks for all algorithms.While the authors claim that the reader does not need a ""sophisticated mathematical background,"" the reader will need more than basic math to grasp the underlying concepts. Remember that this text is used as a college text book so do not expect a quick and easy read...the material is very technical as the authors intend to impart a significant understanding of data science.The primary goals of this book are to help the reader view business problems from a data perspective and to understand principles of extracting useful knowledge from data.  A data perspective provides structure and principles; an objective framework to systemically analyze business problems. In today's world, it has become increasingly important to, at the very least, understand the basics of data science, even if you never intend to use it yourself. Data analytic thinking is the key to business in the 21st Century.",Data Science for Business: What you need to know about data mining and data-analytic thinking,31.89

It is an education book for business people not for technical crowd.Book explains Data science and data mining concepts in very crisp manner.

I guess you will.Book is around 500 pages long which makes it difficult to read but still book has good content for business folks without using arcane jargon.,Data Science for Business: What you need to know about data mining and data-analytic thinking,31.89
251,1449361323,"If you're thinking of analyzing large datasets for common business applications (e.g. targeted marketing), this book will give you everything you need to know and then some. It not only gives an overview of the most popular techniques for prediction and categorization, but also highlights some of the subtler technical issues involved (overfitting, choosing an appropriate loss function) as well as higher-level concerns (privacy, comprehensibility).

252,1449361323,"""Data Science"", ""Data Mining"" and ""Predictive Analytics"" are some of the terms of recent vintage that define the application of modern mathematics, enabled by twenty-first century computing power, to identify patterns in the staggering quantities of data that can be so easily acquired and accessed.  This new technology has such important ramifications in areas ranging from market behaviour to cyber security that even laymen need to have an understanding of its far reaching implications.  One recent effort to make these ideas intelligible to the non-expert, the rather puerile ""Predictive Analytics"" by Eric Siegel, failed miserably.  This book comes much closer to the mark.With a readable, almost conversational, style Provost and Fawcett describe some of the fundamental notions in data science, casually discussing such standard topics as supervised and unsupervised learning, clustering, regression, linear discriminants, model building and even a pseudo introduction to Support Vector Machines.  There is also a chapter on the danger of over fitting, a common malady afflicting those new to machine learning.  Of course, the authors' stated desire to avoid any genuine maths renders some of the descriptions opaque and even misleading.  Nevertheless, the alert layman will come away with a decent familiarity with some of the concepts and methods employed in this rapidly evolving technology.",Data Science for Business: What you need to know about data mining and data-analytic thinking,31.89

Halfway through the book, and I must say this is best technical textbook I have read for so far.(The first time all my codes ran without tweaking).Thanks to the ipython-notebook -virtual environment that accompanied the book.The author gives a somewhat thorough explanation of his codes. Every chapter in the book contains a lot of links to some important sites,so  you need to connect to the internet while reading the book.Late last year, I was watching a youtube video where Linkedin staffs were displaying  their clustered professional networks .

254,1449367615,"I like O'Reilly books, it is a trusted source of technical information for me. Generally speaking, when encounter a new topic I look for the 'Learning' and 'Programming' series from O'Reilly. I think this book actually RAISES the bar for O'Reilly publishing in an already elevated plane. Here are my reasoning:1. Virtual Machine experience: Bar none, the best thing about this book is the companion Virtual Machine experience. Like many other reviewers mentioned, having a safe playground with demonstrable solution is invaluable. With the breadth and depth of the topics the books tries to cover, without the VM I think the weight of the information might just be overwhelming. I challenge O'Reilly to have a more interactive experience such as this one. &#34;Think Python&#34; has an interactive website, but that is not maintained by the author nor was the JavaScript experience as good as IPython Notebook.2. Engaged author: You can tell the author cares about his work, very, very much and take user feedbacks seriously. Don't take my word for it, check out the book's Facebook page or Twitter feed and judge for yourselves.3. Great Content: Funny this is number 3 on my list. But I really do think the other two comes before it. The contents are educational and informative. I learned a lot and feel like I am on good ground to go further in each of the topic if choose to.That is it. Nothing fancy, just three reasons I think why you should give this book a shot. Cheers.","Mining the Social Web: Data Mining Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google+, GitHub, and More",31.2
255,1449367615,"This book is extremely practical and has great code samples. It's easy to follow and fun! If you're interested in mining Twitter data, there is an (large) chapter focused entirely on reproducible code snippets that use the Twitter API.","Mining the Social Web: Data Mining Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google+, GitHub, and More",31.2
256,1449367615,"The hardest part of learning a data analysis method is not in implementing the method, it is applying the method in the context of a real data problem. And data mining and machine learning texts often skirt the issue by using pre-processed data sets and problems defined to fit the method being taught. Russell uses analysis of social media sites to set a context where you start from having to gain access to real data sets, clean and transform the data into forms that your analytical libraries can make sense of, and then use the results to make a conclusion. For that, it rates a place along any other text that focuses more on the analytical methodology itself.What I most appreciated about this book was the work put into converting data from one format to another. From the beginning, when he works with data pulled using a services API, then getting that into a format that another library requires, then getting those results into a data mining framework for analysis. Following his flow has helped me understand the methods better. And these examples of processing data from format to format is something that gets my students stuck before they get really started in a project. I especially appreciated the chapters that worked with the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) and the NetworkX graph libraries. These examples helped me get pass what was the hard part for me in working with these libraries in previous encounters.The virtual machine is also very helpful. I have always found the hardest part of working with Python for analytic computing has been teaching my collaborators how to get set up. And in data mining this is even harder than standard. I was able to get through his book installing everything on one machine, but on another I used the author's virtual machine, and I have pointed a student who was working with me to the virtual machine as well.This is a great book to work through the mess of implementing data mining methods in real situations. It is not a theory book, but it serves its purpose well.Note: I received a free electronic copy of this book from the O'Reilly Press Blogger program.","Mining the Social Web: Data Mining Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google+, GitHub, and More",31.2

258,1449367615,"In the Fall of 2013, I attended THAT (The Humanities and Technology) Camp &#8211; Pittsburgh.  One of the sessions that was most interesting was in part, a discussion of using data mining to examine a series of letters to show relationships between authors over a period of time to help, among other things, begin to sketch out relationships and influences on writing style.  I was immediately struck at the value of applying this to one of my own areas of study &#8211; the epistolary gregarious (and often quarrelsome) Beat Generation writers.  However, my experience with the technique was almost nil.  When Matthew A. Russell&#8217;s Mining the Social Web became available, I picked up a copy in hopes that it would provide me a door into the practice, and was not disappointed.As a relative newcomer to the world of Data Mining, Matthew A. Russell&#8217;s Mining the Social Web is a welcome guide.  Russell&#8217;s discussion includes a step by step approach, complete with code examples and samples from GitHub that make this a useful primer even for those, like me, with limited programming experience (especially useful, though not necessary, for interacting with the book is a basic understanding or some experience with the Python language).The book has a very broad scope (as is appropriate for a primer) and will require a level of dedication from those new to the field.  The book&#8217;s examples and discussions are grounded in the Twitter API (and features over 24 examples of &#8220;recipes&#8221; to be used for mining data from the service) and so allows the opportunity to answer questions like:&#8226; Who knows whom, and which people are common to their social networks?&#8226; How frequently are particular people communicating with one another?&#8226; Which social network connections generate the most value for a particular niche?&#8226; How does geography affect your social connections in an online world?&#8226; Who are the most influential/popular people in a social network?&#8226; What are people chatting about (and is it valuable)?&#8226; What are people interested in based upon the human language that they use in adigital world?Mining the Social Web is not a book that&#8217;s designed for a higher level audience, and, I think that&#8217;s a good thing.  Russell knows his audience and hits the sweet spot for those of us looking to either get started or become involved more deeply in the field.So while there may not be directly applicable examples here for my project (Russell doesn&#8217;t do the work for me), the knowledge gained from the text and its use a reference tool and as a spark for ideas makes this a valuable resource for me and others in my particular cohort within the digital humanities (A final, parenthetical piece of advice: Mining the Social Web works much better as an e-book purchase because of the many, many hyperlinks embedded.

259,1449367615,"Why in the world would anyone want to mine data from social websites, you may be asking yourself just about now. Good question. Suppose you were in the process of creating a product, but at the same time you are curious as to which niche it would fit into. You may also be curious as to which niche is the most financially beneficial for your product, as well as perhaps you should tweak it to maximize your particular niche after mining the web for this data.Who would benefit from this product the most? And best of all, which social websites do your prospective buyers frequent the most. Is it Facebook? What about Twitter? Do they have a membership on LinkedIn? Are they a member of Google+? Regardless of where they may be, there is a good chance that your data mining will pay off.There is plenty of example code, which makes use of the Python language. There is also IPython Notebook which is an interactive Python interpreter which gives you a notebook like experience from your web browser. With a few clicks from within IPython Notebook, you can be well on your way to learning more about the users of social websites than you might have ever thought possible.A part of the paragraph on IPython is paraphrased from the books itself.

The tools themselves have also evolved, so initial set up locally is a breeze for an experienced programmer.Positive:- This book uses one of the most popular general purpose languages, Python. This book isn&#8217;t written for the complete novice, but anyone with any programming experience shouldn&#8217;t have a problem understanding the code- This book gets the user up and running faster by providing a Vagrant VM with all dependencies as well as IPython notebooks.- Other social media books focus on Facebook and Twitter. This one includes chapters on Google+, LinkedIn, and Github, as well as more traditional data mining on mailboxes and webpages.Negative:This book is not for Python beginners. The book does try to explain what some Python features are, but Python itself is out of scope for this book.Overall, it&#8217;s a very good purchase for those who need to learn how to use social media APIs quickly.","Mining the Social Web: Data Mining Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google+, GitHub, and More",31.2
262,1449367615,"What started out as an initiative by a few companies to make the Internet more social has resulted in many rich (and very large) repositories of human thought, which can now be mined for the insights it provides in the aggregate. This book shows you how to do so. It uses a case study format to describe how to download data off these repositories using the respective APIs, how to clean and analyze the data to find connections between entities using libraries such as NLTK, and build and navigate interest graphs implicitly created by these communities using libraries such as networkx. The cases use data from Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, Google+ and GitHub, as well as public datasets such as the Enron database.If you are looking for ideas about how you can use Social Network data in your domain of interest, as well as a cookbook that will take you there most of the way, then this book is for you (I fit that profile and I found the book really useful). The ebook version may be preferable because of its embedded hyperlinks out to reference pages on the Internet. The one thing I think would make the book even more effective and easier to read would be to present the code and results in IPython notebook format for the book, while still providing the full code on github.Disclaimer: I requested a copy of the book from the author to review it, and he very kindly made one available for me.","Mining the Social Web: Data Mining Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google+, GitHub, and More",31.2

292,1617290181,"Looking at many good reviews on amazon, I decided to purchase this book. It's a decent book, but IMO it has been edited poorly and the code has not been tested properly.The introduction chapter got me really excited, just like other Manning's ""in Action"" books do. But once I started executing the code in chapter 2 ""Classifying with k-nearest neighbors"" I realized that the code had bugs. Though I could figure out what's wrong and fix the bugs, I did not expect this from Manning, after having read some of their excellent books like (The Quick Python Book, Second Edition,Spring in ActionandHadoop in Action).Moreover the book has some introduction to python and numpy in appendix A. I believe the author could have pointed the reader elsewhere for learning python and those pages could have been used to explain more of numpy and matplotlib, which the author uses freely without any explanation in the text. (Yup, be ready to read some online numpy and matplotlib tutorials and documentation.)If you don't know python, then you can do what I did: readThe Quick Python Book, Second Editionand then attempt this book.The figures in the book are not in color so you need to execute the code to understand what the author is telling. It forces you to actually run the code, which is good, but you can't read this book without a computer in front of you.Finally, I am a big believer in following the conventions of a language. I would have been really happy had the author followed PEP8 ([...]), because along with learning machine learning, you could have learnt some good python coding practices.",Machine Learning in Action,29.48

295,1617290181,"I just finished this excellent book on machine learning that I would recommend to anyone interested in this relevant subject.It is not a research oriented material, but it envisioned as a manual for someone interested in applying the techniques.It is written as a set of easy to follow tutorials on all major subjects in machine learning: k-Nearest Neighbors, decision trees, nave Bayes,logistic regression, support vector machines, classification with the AdaBoost meta-algorithm, FP-trees.Book also has an excellent appendinx on related math (linear algebra, probability) and Hadoop/Map Reduce.Each tutoral starts with very accessible approach to theory of the method,good examples and simple and small examples written in Python that slowly get more complex towards the end of the chapter.I have ran this book by couple of my colleagues who are authorities in machine learning,and they found it valuable as a starting point for learning practical machine learning.Few caveats:Although the book does not officially require significant background in the math,I think that knowing linear algebra and probability more than helps.Book is, to my greatest joy, Python oriented. What some might miss, however,is exposure to the same material throguh well known Java frameworks.",Machine Learning in Action,29.48
296,1617290181,"This book is a good introduction to the main algorithms used in machine learning: linear/logistics regression, kNN, decision and regression trees, naive Bayes, support vector machines, AdaBoost, SVD, and PCA. The author does a good job as presenting complex concepts in a simple fashion.However, many chapters feel more like simplistic summaries around Python code and the editing can be poor at times repeating the same information between a main paragraph and a shaded summary on the next page. I would still recommend this book as a fairly broad overview of these techniques and a valuable starting point for implementing them. It is easy to read and offers a good selection of algorithms.If you are looking for a more formal alternative, I can only recommend the book from Hastie, Tibshirani, and Friedman:The Elements of Statistical Learning. That book presents a more rigorous approach to the same algorithms, their goals, limitations and main variants. It is presented as a reference book but does not drown the reader in an sea of formulas, unlike similar reference books.",Machine Learning in Action,29.48
297,1617290181,"I am new to ML, and I found this book to be easy to read and easy to understand. So, from theoretical perspective it's probably a very good book. However, the code samples are just terrible. Obviously, the author is a scientist, and needs a competent developer that can help him with code samples. For some reason he feels the need to praise Python. As result, there is a code sample that says ""This code is a great place to demonstrate how easy it is to process text with Python"", but the example has at least three bugs in 15 lines of code - so the comment turns a compliment into embarrassment.Unfortunately, in many cases the author doesn't explain what he is trying to achieve with his code snippets. Once that is clear, there is usually a much simpler way to accomplish the same thing; with less numpy calls and more regular Python. I get an overall feeling that the book is for mathematicians and statisticians, who will look at code snippets as illustrations - and not for programmers. This feeling is reinforced by the fact that many code snippets in my electronic copy are *images* where nothing can cut and pasted; not to mention that 'el' and 'one', 'oh' and 'zero' look the same.Last, the book is published in 2012, but the author seems completely oblivious to the fact that there is Python 3 in the market.In summary, if this text was accompanied by competent code - it probably would be the best book on the subject",Machine Learning in Action,29.48

Most importantly, this is book is an excellent, quick deep-dive into machine learning.  Kudos to the author and publisher for making this book available to the public.",Machine Learning in Action,29.48
299,1617290181,"I am new to Machine Learning and I found the book a very good hands-on introduction on the subject. The author takes 8 of the Top 10 algorithms in Machine Learning (based on a 2007 survey paper) and implements them in Python. Other reviewers have pointed out that the theoretical explanations and code quality were somewhat lacking, and thats true. However, even though Python is an extremely readable language, machine learning algorithms are (generally) hard, and I found that it helped to understand them better if I typed them out myself, copying/copy-pasting and restructuring the code as I went, and experimenting with the contents of the intermediate data structures in the REPL. Also, once you have a general idea of how it works, it becomes easier to parse the math in the paper on which the algorithm is based.I still don't completely understand all the implementations, but the book did give me some intuition about how to choose the right algorithm for a given problem. I believe that is also important since ML practitioners often use third party algorithms rather than code everything up from scratch. Of course, for the times you do need to code it up from scratch, you can get some valuable insights about machine learning algorithm design from the style adopted in the book - start small, visualize in 2D/3D for insights, then generalize to higher dimensions. The examples cover a wide range, from dating sites to semiconductor plants, so you get a feel for all the different places these algorithms can be applied.In short, if you want to ""Just do ML"", ie, quickly get started and pick up anything else you need along the way, then this book may be for you.",Machine Learning in Action,29.48

Of course, the code has some flaw in itself, However, even I am a novice to Python, the algorithm and code is easy to understand. May be good for someone who want to learn ML in a practical manner. And if you know something about ML, this is a good complement with regard to a practical implementation of ML algorithm. However, this book in itself is not a good textbook to begin with.

302,1617291560,"tl;dr: A well rounded, occasionally high-level introductory text that will leave you feeling prepared to participate in the Data Science conversation at work, from earliest planning to presentation and maintenance.Details:Was excited to see this book coming to publication. I'm a fan of practical, non-academic approaches to subjects and prefer working from concrete examples to abstract principles (rather than the other way around). I think this is both the most difficult and most needed type of resources that can be put into print. This book handles the task ok; it falls a bit short on practical, concrete, use cases as it alternates between working with hands on datasets and shotgun coverage of principles and techniques at a higher level. I'd have much preferred sticking with single data-sets for longer (say, a couple chapters per data set), but didn't feel cheated out of hands on work.Pros:- Easy access to the datasets via Github; good documentation on where to find others- Key Takeaways provided at end of chapter are good summaries of overall information provided.- A good focus on not just data analysis, but the process as a whole; very Agile like, practical, and non-dogmatic.- Battle tested advice: You can tell some of the advice comes from hard-fought battles - ex: Why not use the sample() function instead of manually creating a sample column? Because with a sample column, you can repeatably sample the same data (e.g. all columns &lt; 2) for repeatable output and for regression testing (avoiding introducing bugs).- Builds your analyst vocabulary, increasing your all-important google-fu skills. Not knowing what to Google is, imho, the single hardest problem when learning a new set of problems / api's.- Good use of Appendices for introducing R syntax / installation, rather then stuffing it into one of the early chapters.Cons:- Doesn't stick with data sets long enough. I went to the trouble of setting up a true database to use the first dataset (chapter 2); only to move on to a different data set in the very next chapter (book did eventually return to the data set).- Feels a bit back and forth at times on whether it wants to be a truly pragmatic, focused work or a principles driven, broadly scoped book (thinking of chapters 5-7 here). Not necessarily a knock depending on what your looking for.I've ready a few books on getting started in data analysis, R, statistics, etc. This book is solid enough that were I to choose among them, I'd recommend it first. I think if the book focused down on using data-sets for longer stretches, allowing you to learn the data well and apply multiple types of analyses on top of it (especially earlier on), it would be a bit more engaging.Lastly, its has good coverage of R principles but (per its scope) doesn't get into the nitty gritty. I'd recommend ""The Art of R Programming"" for that, which would be a good companion to this book (e.g. covers R but not Data Analysis). I've heard R in Action is good as well, though haven't read it. Caveat emptor.Disclaimer: I received a e-copy of the book from Manning for review.",Practical Data Science with R,42.49
303,1617291560,"A problem with the other reviews is that they consider the book in isolation, as if no alternatives were available. ""Practical data science"" is not the only machine-learning-lite book on the market: Manning itself had published Harrington's Python-based ""Machine learning in action"", Packt offers ""Machine learning with R"" by Lantz, O'Reilly boasts ""Doing data science"" by Schutt and O'Neil, and, finally, Springer has ""Introduction to statistical learning"" by James, Witten, Hastie and Tibshirani. I have seen and reviewed all except Harrington's; for the purposes of this review, I'll ultra-briefly describe each contender (""Machine learning with R"" - thin, average-quality, superficial, but effective at what it sets out to achieve; ""Doing data science"" - a mash-up of a textbook and a magazine article about kewl data scientists; below-average quality, but a lot of pop appeal; ""Introduction to statistical learning"" - high-quality, accessible and visually appealing textbook with R illustrations) and get to ""Practical data science"" - which, to me, comes across as a better-organized, earnest version of ""Doing data science"". The book's forte is its effort to go beyond a catalogue of R-illustrated machine-learning methods - and you have to have seen similar books to know how standard this repertoire is - and discuss practical skills useful to a budding ""data scientist"", from version control to presenting. I appreciate this effort, but feel that this content was not sufficiently substantial or polished to develop into a ""unique selling proposition"" of the kind that each of its competitors has - hence the title of my review.",Practical Data Science with R,42.49
304,1617291560,"What is R? If I am not mistaken, R stands for regression.This book isn't about using R for regression.The &#34;data science&#34; the authors refer to seems to involve analyzing data around basic ratios and graphs. At least for me, some of the codes provided using ggplot2 did not work properly using the downloaded datasets.Another point of annoyance: downloading the datasets used in this book required me to download and use GitHub, which to me is a sorry piece of software that I would otherwise never use. What a hassle that was.The book assumes you are already familiar with statistics. I specifically do not recommend this book for those who are trying to learn and understand regression using R.Pros:1)Fantastic examples on how to use the graphing features of R.2)Good breakdown of basic data analysis (not on regression).Cons:1)Scant information on statistics and R.

Detailed explanations from multiple angles tie together the entire process of data science from novice to master.  The R statistical programming language is used extensively with clear examples of code and data visualizations.  The author leaves no stone unturned while covering topics broad and narrow.

306,1617291560,"I've had to hire recent graduates with degrees in machine learning, operations research and even &#34;data science.&#34; One of the problems with such people: they don't know anything practical. They probably know the basics of regression and some classification routines, as learned in their coursework. They've probably worked on one or many data science like problems, using machine learning techniques or regression or what not.  Many of them have never done a SQL query, or done the dirty business of data cleaning which takes up most of the data scientist's time. They'll always have gaps in their education; maybe they wrote a dissertation on an application of trees or deep learning, and have never used any of the other myriad tools available to the data scientist. None of them have ever done data science for money, and so none of them know about practical things like git or what the process looks like in an industrial setting. It is for these people that this book appears to be written. In an ideal world, all larval data scientists would be taught a course based on this book, or at least go through it themselves. It is also useful to experienced practitioners, as it covers many things, and can be a good practical reference to keep around.  The book is ordered as a data science project would be ordered, from start to finish; so, as you proceed down an engagement, reviewing the chapters in order will be helpful.Ch1 describes the job of the data scientist, the workflow, and the characters you run into on a project.Ch2 outlines some of the tools used to get at the data, including the authors tool, &#34;SQL Screwdriver.&#34; I'd have liked some genuflections at the unix tools used to clean data before it is put anywhere important; sed, awk, tr, sort and cut here, but I'm not sure if there is a graceful way of doing this. Or perhaps I'm the only weirdo who uses these in the ETL process.Ch3 exploring data; using the various plot utilities in ggplot2 (the graphics library everyone should be using); bar charts, histograms, summary statistics and scatter plots.Ch4 managing data: what they call &#34;cleaning data&#34; -I call reshaping data (and I use reshape, sometimes anyway; I would have mentioned this, though I got on well without it for years)Ch5 gets into specifying the problem; is it a classification problem? scoring? recommendation engine? How do I quantify success? This chapter is very helpful in doing this. Of course, problems evolve over time, and customers change their minds, but there are very helpful mappings here which will point you in the right direction There are a few new techniques which should probably be included in future editions of this chapter, depending on how they pan out: I'm impressed with using drop out techniques to prevent overfitting, for example (this is bleeding edge stuff, generally in context of deep learning).Ch6 Memorization techniques covers Naive Bayes, KNN and decision trees. It would have been nice to have more information on the various kinds of variable selection techniques (particularly important for NB and KNN), but mentioning this will allow the practitioner to go find their own information.Ch7 Logistic and Linear regression: most would have done these first, but these are actually more complex than memorization techniques, and there are more things to know to keep the practitioner out of trouble. In my opinion, this chapter really shines: everyone who is going to do this for a living has had some exposure to regression models: this chapter makes it practical.Ch8 Unsupervised methods; covers clustering; heirarchical clustering (one of the most useful tricks you will use in data science), kmeans (it has to be done, though I never found it to be useful) and association rules.Ch9 Advanced methods: GAMs, SVM, bagging and random forests (the importance measure trick: if you don't know it, pay attention: this is a very good trick). These are the &#34;industrial strength&#34; tools used in industry. I, personally would have stuck GAMs in their own chapter, and mentioned boosting here, but everyone is a little different in their tastes.Ch10 Documentation and deployment: they use Knitr; I just use vanilla Sweave (I've tried brew, but never took to it). They introduce git here: something I would have done in chapter 1 or 2, but it is a fairly natural place to mention it. They use the Rook tool to deploy HTTP services; I've never used it, though I have used Shiny, which I can recommend. They mention PMML briefly (I've never used it).The appendix on R is helpful, though it doesn't include the most valuable advice of all for using R in production: you need to maintain a distribution of R and all used packages, as well as a dependency toolchain if the code will be deployed on multiple servers.",Practical Data Science with R,42.49

It also re-covers most of the topics in machine learning, lick ROC and feature selections. I consider it as my practical guide in all-day python programming.Good as it is, to be honest, this print contains lots of errors. It includes formatting errors, like the indents are not aligned, which are deadly in Python writing and reading. I also suspect that some graphs are erroneously labelled, For example, there are a series of graphs in Chapter 5 depicting the train errors and test errors, but the test errors are obviously and consistently lower than the train errors, which is practically not very likely. Plus the authors in-text description also contradicts the graphs (i. e. &#34;dashed lines are test errors&#34;, &#34;stay above 0.4&#34;).Some of topics are explained very well. I am very grateful that the authors dissected the PCA and LDA so well. Learned a lot there. But the book as a whole is not consistently so &#34;layman&#34; from the shallow then to the deep.

Sadly, before I ran across this book, everything else I had studied on ML had turned out to be a waste of my time. I am primarily a self-taught programmer --- by choice not necessity. And I am offended when I run across topics like ML which have developed the reputation of being some sort of dark art which only exceptionally talented programmers can understand. The problem is not that ML is hard to learn. The problem is that publishers are pushing out books written by authors who are great programmers but lousy teachers.Even worse, the publishers, obviously, are not hiring competent programmers to proof read the examples. Hence, users fix broken code examples after publication and pass the errata back to the author via the book's website. Which is why downloaded examples work but the book's examples frequently do not. Hence, make sure you download the examples, not just read about them, if you expect them to actually work.",Building Machine Learning Systems with Python,18.49
311,1782161406,"Python has an excellent ecosystem of libraries for Machine Learning. The libraries are all well-documented but sometimes it is hard to figure out how to solve a problem end-to-end using one or more of these libraries. This book attempts to fill that niche. It contains 12 chapters, each focusing on one or two ML problems, and shows how an expert ML practitioner would build and evaluate solutions for these problems. The main focus of the book is on the famous Scikits-Learn library, along with its dependencies Numpy and Scipy, but there is also coverage of gensim (for topic modeling), mahotas (for image processing), jug and starcluster (for distributed computing). The tone of the book is very practical and hands-on, in the rare cases where theory is explained, it is done without math. At the same time, the book is much more than just an introduction to Python ML libraries - you will come away learning ""insider secrets"" that you can do to improve your solution and which are already available as API calls within one of these libraries.The authors say that this book was written to their younger selves - in my opinion a very accurate representation of the target audience.

313,1782162143,"This book is fantastic.  I've been through the first four chapters, so I can't give a complete review yet, but if the rest of the book conains surprises, I will update.Chapter 3 is on k-nearest neighbor and chapter 4 is on naive Bayes.  Both provide a clear explanation of the technique, and its pros and cons, along with a simple, non-programming example.  Then there is an excellent walkthrough of applying the technique to real world data, and some hints at how to improve the results by adjusting the inputs.  After each chapter, I felt that I was ready to apply the technique, with the understanding that I did not yet understand everything about the topic.  The chapters also are careful to explain that 1) the particular R package used has more options than have been covered and 2) there are other R packages to be investigated and experimented with.I just couldn't be happier with these chapters, and I am fired up to keep reading and working along with the examples.  It has been years since I have been reading a tech book and thinking, &#34;OK, just a little bit more, I don't want to quit yet&#34; instead of, &#34;Have I spent enough time and effort on this for one day yet?&#34;  It's that good.Although the book does provide a bit of an introduction to R, it is by no means comprehensive, and I have found that R takes time, patience and frustration to master (not that I've mastered it yet).  So if I had been a complete R newbie, I probably would have struggled more.I also found that a recent course I took in statistical inference was helpful, although not really required.  At one point the book describes normalizing features using Z scores.  I knew what Z scores were, so that was a point I didn't need to simply take on faith.If you are relatively new to R and machine learning, and you want to learn to do machine learning with R, this *is* the book.",Machine Learning with R,20.44
314,1782162143,"This is a great book. I liked the way authors highlight syntax for models and discuss strengths and weeknesses. It has a nice balance of theory and hands-on training. However, I would need to use a R book, such as R in action, in conjunction with it.I have looked at many books on the topic. I will put my review for all of these. Perhaps this can save you some time.1) http://www.amazon.com/dp/0470650931 : Good theoretical book, but badly written and does not have any hands on exercise.2) http://www.amazon.com/dp/1466503963 : This is another great book. Good balance of theory and hands-on exercise. This is an excellent book to start learning data mining and R. However, this book relies on a GUI RCommander. It does a good job and one can do a lot with it but it has its limitations. However, I will still use this book.3) http://www.amazon.com/dp/1439810184 : This is an advanced book and heavily entrinched in cases. This makes it difficult to replicate things unless your work is directly related to one of the case studies covered.4) http://www.amazon.com/dp/0133412938 : Good examples, but does not explain much about the interpretation. This leaves one wondering what is the purpose of certain graph, what are the axis and how to interpret it. if appropriate explanation is added, this would be an excellent book.5) http://www.amazon.com/dp/111844714X : This book is very expensive and almost totally devoid of any theory or discussion. I would not use it.6) http://www.amazon.com/dp/1441998896: This is a decent book. It relies on another GUI, Rattle. It is a strong contender to the book 2 in this list.",Machine Learning with R,20.44
315,1782162143,"Some of the other reviewers seem to be unclear on the concept of &#34;introduction&#34;, demanding rigor and depth - and, unfortunately, not suggesting any alternatives. If you want deep understanding of the algorithms, you will need to start with a proper textbook, like &#34;Pattern matching&#34; by Bishop, or &#34;Elements of statistical learning&#34; by Hastie and Tibshirani. If you want a more accessible, high-level presentation with examples that can be reproduced, in R, you want to get &#34;Introduction to statistical learning&#34;  by James, Witten, Hastie and Tibshirani. If you want a *really* accessible introduction to the techniques - again, with examples that you can try and build on - well, &#34;Machine learning with R&#34; just might be the best choice today. (On R side; if you have invested in Python,  Peter Harrington's &#34;Machine learning in action&#34; and books by Wes McKinney are a good bet). OK, this is not an outstanding book, it is under-edited and plain-looking - unfortunately, Packt follow the no-frills approach of O'Reilly - but it is friendly, reasonably well written, and offers a good deal of content. (Extra brownie points for Chapter 11). Let me put it this way: you want to read &#34;Introduction to statistical learning&#34;, but &#34;Machine learning with R&#34; is a good warm-up.",Machine Learning with R,20.44
316,1782162143,"If you are new to both machine learning and R and want to learn both at the same time, I can't imagine there being a better book.I needed to figure out how to implement nearest neighbors, decision trees, SVM, neural networks, and boosting on two data sets, in a short amount of time. I had no experience with R and my only prior experience with machine learning was neural networks. Using this book I was able to implement four algorithms in R. For each topic the book describes an application, the algorithm, provides code to implement the algorithm. You can download the data set from the publisher's website so you can try it out.",Machine Learning with R,20.44
317,1782162143,"For $20.44 I expected a book that was useful. Indeed, if I were a High School student, I might have found this book useful. The book does provide a shallow overview of Machine Learning, with some R code. The book carefully explains things like standard deviation (if you need this background I recommend A Cartoon Guide to Statistics (seriously)). But there is no depth at all and the introduction to R is cursory. This is not a book in the Springer Use R! series.If you're not a High School student and you know basic statistics and basic college level math, this book will not be much use to you. Since there is so little in the way of background information, the book will be of no use in actually implementing Machine Learning algorithms. Machine Learning is a deep topic and this book has the depth of a rain puddle.",Machine Learning with R,20.44
318,1782162143,"Clear writingEasy explained text.I can recommend this book for beginers and people without math background.Not many math details and theory, but plenty of selfcontained examples",Machine Learning with R,20.44
319,1782162143,This book is about learning to use the tool.  I am just still starting in the book and cannot comment on how comprehensive it will be regarding covering the totality of R.  But the approach is excellent and easy to follow.,Machine Learning with R,20.44
320,1782162143,"The writing is sparse and clear.  The examples and the code are straightforward and easy to understand.  I wish I had read this years ago when I was first learning to use R.  If you are new to R, definitely buy this book.",Machine Learning with R,20.44
