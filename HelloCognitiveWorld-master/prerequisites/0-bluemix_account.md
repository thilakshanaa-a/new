Description of this lesson:
- **Type**: step-by-step tutorial
- **Estimated time for completion**: 20 mins.


## Rationale

IBM Bluemix is a **platform** that provides machine learning / artificial intelligence **components**.

Designing a product based on Bluemix/Watson will require to **create instances** of the available components, and **open permissions** for your application to connect to them. When required by your application, these components will be **executing on IBM's cloud**.

The components of that platform are made available through a **web console**. You will use that web console to **manage the components** you want to embed into your applications. To access tha web console, you need to create an IBM Bluemix account.

_Note: Opening an account creates a free 1 month trial period. In that period most of the Watson component will be provided for free._

## \#2 Setting up your account

_Note: that section may happen differently if you've already created an IBM account through the Data Science Experience registration process. You don't need to use the specific organization and space names._

1. Login into the [IBM Bluemix Console](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/login/).

2. On the first login, IBM Bluemix will ask you to setup a few things. After you have accepted the conditions (**step 1**), you need to create an organization (**step 2**). You can use "CBC-yourname" as your organization name, or something else you'd like.

3. Next, you will need to create a space (**step 3**). It will be a simplified way to handle the components you create, and manage the permissions. You can use "CBC Dev Space" in there, or anything else you'd like.
